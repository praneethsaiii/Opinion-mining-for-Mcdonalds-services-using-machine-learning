This is located right at the times square visitors center. So you can starve and walk till you reach the vistors center and have good food here.

Strategically located close to time square. It´s a reliable meal when you are far from home and you are in a rush.
Service was fast and good.

Of course always busy and pretty slow service. The food wasn't that hot but I've been to worse places and better ones too!
"
"3" "rn306138828" "It's Mcdonald's" "
Crowded but the service was ok. Had to walk upstairs to sit and eat that's what I disliked. The prices were average for Times square

Just went because it is the largest McDonald's. Same old stuff but, a great people watching place if you can find room. Heard all kids of languages talking and so crowed.
"
"5" "rn303270817" "Chaotic Fast Food" "
It is for the most part what you would expect. The food quality and service are typical of any McDonalds, however this one is far more crowded than your average neighborhood fast food restaurant.
I would have rated it higher. Its fine that it is crowded and busy, but with a little effort managment could better organize the place. Its...

Try the Beef burger! I liked the quality of the meat. It was tasty. The fillet-o-fish was also damn fresh. The sitting place is a bit shady like the dungeon or like social milieu.

I stopped to have a coffee here before the show at the Palace Theater. While I sat at the window, I watched an artist on the street doing caricatures for $5.00. I proceeded
outside and received a fabulous large rendition of me dancing on the skyscrapers of
N.Y.C.'s Times Square. He covered it and matted it like a pro. A...

This McDonald's is right in the heart of Times Square so it is extremely busy. It is a great place to have breakfast in the morning, sitting on the second floor looking out the window onto the crowd outside. During the day, don't expect it to be a quick stop because of the crowd inside.

"9" "rn299714651" "It is what it is, it's Mc Donalds" "
For a local McDonalds, I thought the service and food was a little above average. The cheeseburger here was better than most of the others I have had recently. What the standout was to give it its very good is a new product called the Frozen Strawberry Lemonade. It is so good on a hot day and it cuts through...

As a lover of McDonalds I couldn't wait to try my first MD in New York. However I was so disappointed,the burgers were tiny compared to the UK burgers and there was so much salt in it that it was horrible to eat. The fries were also very different and instead of the lovely crisp fries like I normally eat,...

Whilst you are paying the earth for places to eat around Time Square, the trusted MCD remains loyal, its like every other store but just very busy.
"
"3" "rn293935096" "Eat elsewhere or find a different McDonald's. GO AT YOUR OWN RISK" "
Just too crowded. Dirty. Loud. This location kind of attracts a lot of the classless characters you may find in Times Square. But at least the employees are kind of nice.

I asked how much it was for a meal and she told me the price and put it on her machine and I said no sorry I don't want that don't have enough and she huffed and puffed at me when it's clearly her fault her hearings bad I then asked for fries and she took 30
Minutes to get...

Stopped by for a quick breakfast before heading to the airport. Loved the coffee. The sausage and egg biscuit was good. Quick service and easy access.
"
"6" "rn293106825" "McDonalds is a cheap place to rest weary feet" "
Watch out for panhandlers. They like to interrupt your meal to beg and no-one stops them. You can get some good views from this strategically placed McDonalds and it's a cheap place to sit if you've been on your feet for a long time.
"
"7" "rn289333946" "It's a McDonald's" "
All I can say is it isn't the cleanest McDonald's I have been to. But to be fair it is very busy and that would make it difficult to keep up with cleanliness.
"
"8" "rn288675675" "Nice Stop for a Break" "
This whole area is so busy that we decided to pop into McDonalds for a quick bite and to relax. It is a a large restaurant with an upper floor, so there is lots of seating. The service was quick, the lunch was hot, and we got a table to eat at. It was very busy when we were there...

Good coffee is all I can say. Food and service very, very average. Only go here if you have no more than $5 on you.
"
"10" "rn285097843" "Good, but..." "
The good thing about McD is the consistency, almost no matter where you are in the world. There are decent restrooms and usually you can find seats to get some rest during a short brake. The bad thing is that the place is boring and plastic.
