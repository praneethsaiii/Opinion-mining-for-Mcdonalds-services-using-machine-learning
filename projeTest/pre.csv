"3","the managers at this mcdonalds are awesome but some of the workers are lazy „‚overall an average mcdonalds „‚after visiting it and some other once i realized that this one is really average „‚the only thing good about this one is that the management is awesome and its across the street from my house so i can sit around and study till midnight and no one bothers me"
"4","came here for a quick to go lunch first my cheeseburgers were not right i had requested no onions and they were covered with them then second the fries were so mushy and not fresh i was sorely disappointed"
"5","mcdonalds will be mcdonalds so ive based my review on service alone cashier had no personality he didnt smile or even was interested on working he looked and sounded miserable taking my order the manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day"
"6","pretty good service for fast food"
"7","what the freaknik is thisthere arecars in the drive thru at am „‚is everybody going to mickey dees todayyou can guess that volumes of business like this means that someones going to get their order wrongand today it was methey put cheese on my steak biscuit but i requested a steak and egg bagel i had to request a straw for my large soda „‚guess i should have checked my sandwich while i looked for the missing strawi expect much better from a mickey dees"

"9","hot tipif you have to go to this location in the mornings lunch hour or evenings it is invariable that the jimmy carter blvd and peachtree industrial intersection just west of this mcdonalds backs up past the entrance to mcdonaldssorather than taking your life in your hands by trying to turn left through three lanes of traffic simply drivefeet pass this mcdonalds and turn left at the traffic light then travel back through the parking lot to your get your mcgrub without inconveniencing all the people in cars trying to get to work or homethis advice makes much more sense than the numbskulls trying to cut through solid traffic just to get some fast food and for you people who chose to live in hidden cove next to and east of mcdonalds you have no luck in being able to pull out easily the traffic is always solid in front of that entranceexit and you really should have chosen another place to live with easy egress i know a clue is a lot to ask for these days"
"10","came to this mcdonalds a couple of times and tried to order a few drinks and their machine did not work for anything no hot chocolate no hot mocha no anything on top of that the lady in the drive thru said it hasnt worked for a couple of months a multi million dollar company and they cant fix the machines „‚wth not coming to this mcd again „‚and they are slowmins to get a drink"
"11","very rude staff „‚the food is typical mcdonalds food bad „‚head for the chickfla across the street"
"12","worst mcdonalds ever they are unable to get an order correct went through the drive through last night got home and no fries in my bag got to the window and the woman running the window was talking about her personal life with a co worker laughing it up with her back t us making us wait instead of giving us our ice coffee then she seemed to remember she was working and brought us our coffee last time i went there i ordered something with no mayo which my tix said got home and covered in mayo called up to complain and the responsewhat do u want me to do about it if i get the craving for mcdonalds i will drive out of my way i hope this one goes out of business „‚this location is good for nothing"
"13","its mcdonalds for fs sake it is what it is the food sucks but it is usually microwaved or fried within a debatable somewhat reasonable amt of time staff are usually genuinely unhappy but nice none the less"
"14","the drive thru makes them lost a star since my last reviewthis is one of those two lane drive thrus and i know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window but almost everytime the cashier ends up asking me what did i order „‚i inquired about that before and was told that when someone drives off that messes up the orderwell i guess theres no controlling drive off and at least i know my order has been confirmed so it should be right by the time i get to the second windowthis mcdonalds also has a late night drive thru thursat it use to be ahour on those days but i dont think it is any longer one of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice when you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits but not at this location"
"15","im not crazy about this mcdonalds „‚this is primarily because they are so slow „‚my gosh what exactly is the hold up „‚its fast food people „‚also this morning i guess the worker thought his mic was off but it wasnt „‚i now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money bad „‚spread the word „‚anyway this location is on a little access road „‚and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end „‚it would have helped if there was one „‚so in the end i think ill avoid this location and find another „‚this should be easy as there is no shortage of mickey ds in this piece"
"16","terrible customer service „‚i came in at pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me forminutes „‚there was no one else waiting for their food inside either just outside at the window „‚ i left and went to chickfila next door and was greeted before i was all the way inside this mcdonalds is also dirty the floor was covered with dropped food obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers"
"17","fries were old and coldthey were out of ice asked for the sandwich to be plain it did not come that way they forgot to give us our drinks"
"18","i went to get some food for my wife and i at pm this place is in a hotel so you think they would have staffing nope they hadpeople working and were running out of food as they were taking orders no planning ahead here there were almostpeople in line and took over half an hour to get my food it was ridiculous"
"19","i just ordered food from there an hour ago my fries were all stale and cold they must have been old they forgot to give me my drink ive been trying to call them and their phones are busy worst mcdonalds i have ever been too i tried to be nice yesterday and compliment them since it was christmas but i feel like it was a mistake"

"22","regular mcdonalds close to the highway which can be good and bad"
"23","this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever visited „‚we sat at the drivethru window forever watching the employees goof off „‚the fish sandwich was edible in a square processed fish round bun too much tartar sauce sort of way „‚the french fries were horrible „‚they were not edible „‚they were stale and greasyjust because someone is holding a broom does not mean that they are sweeping „‚the broom is a prop to make people think they are working while they are socializing with coworkers „‚they will look at you occasionally while they continue to goof off „‚the employees seem to go out of their way to prove that you arent worth their time „‚this mcdonalds really sucks"
"24","im not ashamed to admit that i frequent this mcdonalds at least twice a week „‚need a snack after pumping gas „‚need coffee before chocolatte is open or after chocolatte is closed „‚need nightafterdrinking breakfast „‚yes please on all counts „‚i havent found this mcdonalds to be particularly slow „‚it is a bit sketch by decatur standards although its north decatur and not decatur proper „‚often at night there are folks who look homeless here though only one one occasion has anything particularly creepydisturbing happened regarding said demographic of patron „‚otherwise its lots of emory students and hospital workers and high school students from druid hills high „‚i like that the workers seem to have a good camaraderie with each other „‚i also like that folks remember my standard order and can associate my voice with my order when i go through the drive thru"
"25","walked into this place for the first time to get an ice cream cone while my wife shopped at nearby pet store the older lady wearing glasses behind the counter asked me if i wanted it togo togoits an ice cream cone anyway i said togo this lady then gave me the biggest yarn as she handed me my change then i watched her drop some kind of plastic cup on to the floor but didnt pick it up right away she looked like she didnt want to be there at all i watched her prepare my ice cream cone then she decided to pickup that cup she dropped on the floor earlier what gets me is the way she picked it up looked like as if she was picking up albs weight at the gym then as she was handing me my ice cream she says to me welcome welcome for what „‚i havent said my thank you yet„‚as if she was doing me a big favor „‚i grewup in japan where a customer service is probably the best in the world so maybe im little too critical but i do know one thing if this was a mcdonalds in japan she be so fired"

"42","on my way to curry honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment i went to the drivethru of this mcdonalds since it was so conveniently located almost adjacent to the honda dealership „‚it was aroundpm on a saturday afternoon and there were probably only two cars in front of me so i thought id be in and out of there quickly „‚what i thought would be a quick drivethru took over ten minutes „‚im not sure what the hold up was but perhaps one or both of the cars in front of me got a large order „‚all i ordered was a spicy mcchicken sandwich small fries and a cup of ice wateragain curry honda is located super close to the mcdonalds so the food should have still been hot or at least warm when i got there „‚however when i sat down to eat my food in the waiting room i noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm and the ice in my water was almost completely melted „‚i guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers „‚boo „‚it was my first time trying the spicy mcchicken sandwich and i thought it was decent „‚it has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol mcchicken sandwichoverall this mcdonalds getsstars for being ok „‚yes service could have been quicker and the food should have been served hotter but this is a mcdonalds and at least the employees were friendly „‚i may return to this mcdonalds if im on my way to curry honda and didnt have time to grab food elsewhere but it wouldnt be my top choice for fast food in the areareviewof"
"43","this mcdonalds is located right next to the building which houses studio movie grill „‚its super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you dont want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater „‚but thats pretty much where the pros of this location stopive been to this mcdonalds several times but ive been a bit disappointed on several occasions „‚most recently i went through the drivethru and got a simple ordera mcchicken sandwich and small fries „‚i drove to the studio movie grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fries were cold „‚ughhhhh „‚cold mcdonalds fries are the worst „‚lamethe employees seem to be pretty friendly and the restaurant looks decent inside unfortunately they lack power outlets i saw one but maybe theres a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant „‚this makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by mcdonalds to use their laptops which i do quite oftenoverall this mcdonalds deserves aboutstars because its right in between meh and aok „‚i know some may say its just a mcdonalds but heyive been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent dont serve cold fries and there are numerous power outlets for customers use „‚ill probably be back just because its right next to studio movie grill but im hoping theyll start improving the quality of their fast foodat least to the mcdonalds standardreviewof"

"146","i usually dont have problems with this location even though i get irritated with their employees attitudes sometimes today however my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there the one worker that i absolutely dread encountering is the slightly older woman with glasses who is on the heavier side she has the worst attitude out of all the workers there and it is clear that she hates her job she is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right when i drove up to the pick up window a teenage employee was there and gave me my bag of food i ordered two combos i waited aboutseconds for my drinks and he was awkwardly standing there wondering why i didnt drive off yet then he asked are you waiting for something else that should be it i said we ordered drinks too he looks behind him and there are my drinks oh he exclaims as i am situating the drinks into my cup holders i hear him say here when i turn around towards the window half of his arm is in my car and the straws almost hit my face wtf i was so irritated by his incompetency also one thing that i dont like is how two drivethru speakers are built but the employees are always confused by which one to use for example i would order at the first speaker when there is a long line i get stuck at the second speaker and a worker tries to take my order there when i already ordered at the first one sometimes i tell them that ive already ordered and sometimes i ignore them even when theyre constantly asking hello are you ready to orderincompetent workers and a confusing drivethru so annoying"

"148","this mcdonalds is located at the food side entrance of the nellis at craig walmart super center at the time that i stopped in walmart on the way to utah i ate breakfast here this mcdonalds exceeded my expectations i expected a shoddy mcdonalds in one of the las vegas valley s older super centers instead i was eating in a clean and surprisingly cozy mcdonalds i am under the impression that it was recently refurbished the interior shows off mcdonalds history through portraits of the first mcdonalds the booths are extraordinary comfortable for „‚a mcdonalds disparate from a few las vegas valley walmart mcdonalds this location offers more breakfast items including the egg mcmuffin „‚on my visit they served me the egg mcmahon meal in a short period of time the coffee was hot and i left satisfied „‚keep in mind that i ate here aroundam before the saturday morning rush so i have not seen how this mcdonalds is when there is a rush of people"

"150","the service at this mcdonalds is so bad its almost comical case in point there was about a two week stretch where i would go to mcdonalds every morning before work to get an iced vanilla latte every day i kid you not they got my order wrong and made me a hot latte instead this would not be a problem but they questioned me every time if i was sure that was what i ordered yes it even showed it on your fancy digital menu then they would ask me to pull up and waitminutes for my order to be corrected my bf and i went inside once to order and they got his order wrong the woman just stood there and looked at us when we told her and my bf was like but i guess i can eat this later when we went up and asked for sauce she gave us the biggest eyeroll upon seeing us and acted like it was physically painful for her to serve us these are only a couple of examples of the horrible service we have had but i guess thats typical for a mcdonalds attached to a gas station"

"158","came in for breakfast and ordered a sausage egg biscuit with an iced mocha the cashier advised me that i couldnt get a mocha when i asked about a frappucino she said no to that too and then mentioned that they were out of orange juice essentially i had the choice of getting a sweet tea or a coke product with my breakfast sandwich and hash brown now that i have experienced sweet tea with a sausage egg biscuit i can say with all certainty that these two items should not be served togetherthis particular mcdonalds does not exude any of mcdonalds core philosophies such as variety or efficiency it seems poorly stocked poorly operated and under maintained the bathrooms are filthy and i would suggest buying a cheap pair of socks for your child because their socks will be coated in dirt afterminutes of playing the only thing that was good about my visit was my sausage egg biscuit sandwich the hash brown tasted as though it had fried in old rancid oil the sweet tea while good by itself shouldnt beofoptions available during the morning since someone or something broke the mccafe machine and ran away with the orange juiceseriously dont go here this is not the mcdonalds youre looking for"
