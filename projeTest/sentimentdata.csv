10,i dont need to review the food as everyone knows what its like either way depending on their opinionthis location is one of the biggest ive ever been in and has free wifi however what makes this place special is the vast assortment of fairly crazy people that hole up here im hardly unsympathetic to the homeless but if youve been here you know what im talking about try itits quite an adventure def some regulars that set up camp who are just plain off which can make it uncomfortable sometimes i actually feel a bit sorry for the staff for all the daily crap they must have to endure belligerent customers who are mentally ill and have plenty of free time it must be fairly soulcrushing but most of the workers manage to still be polite,anger,negative
11,the people are mostly nice at this location but the service is the slowest i have ever seen at a golden arches the drive thru is always packed but that has less to do with them being busy than it taking forever to get your food when you do finally get your food it is the usual mcdonalds fare so no issues there they are also often out of ice cream which is a drag on a hot summer day when thats all you crave when possible i go to the mcdonalds a little farther north on king drive,sadness,neutral
12,standard runofthemill mcdonalds they all kind of blur together for me the only reason why this one stood out at all for me was the fact that the drivethru takes foreveri was seriously notkidding in line for aboutminuteswhich is why i had enough time to checkin and start my review for this place bully for themat least its not as bad as the mcdonalds off of dundee and randby the home depot that one always messes up orders are rude and when they had the monopoly piecesthey actually removed the pieces from my brothers meal absurd,joy,positive

54,the argument can be made that reviewing a mcdonalds is a waste of everyones time „‚this mcdonalds however warrants special mention „‚although the place is reasonably clean and they generally get your order right the length of time it takes for this to happen is genuinely baffling „‚no matter what time of day you come in or how busy the place happens to be it will always take far longer to complete your transaction than it reasonably should „‚in light of the fact that speed is supposed to be the selling point of a mcdonalds id call this particular location a failure,sadness,negative
55,i am not a huge fast food fan because i try to eat healthy however for those cheat days i occasionally splurge on mcdonalds because that is the american way because this mcdonalds is so close to usc this is the one i go to exclusively i cannot speak for the drivethru speed during the day but at night the server usually does not take too long the food is also typical of any mcdonaldsmy complaint here is that no matter when i come i never fail to be heckled by the homeless people around it is incredibly uncomfortable to sit and wait for your food in your car and be yelled at for no reason,joy,negative

87,the worst service ive encountered in a mcdonalds so far in the continental usa no not because i dislike the food but because the employees here are irresponsible forgetful and unapologetic i overheard from one of my superiors that the staff at this particular mcdonalds always screws up orders every time they come here they will charge you for the wrong item leave out several items give iced tea instead of iced coffee when i was there i was the first one to order and i ordered the skillet burrito and some oj my oj came out afterminutes but my food never came out all of my coworkers ordered their food and their food came out and they were already seated and having their breakfast while im still standing at the counter waiting for my burrito for a goodminutes i finally lost my patience and ask the girl who rang me up where my skillet burrito was she simply says oh its run out we no haveh i tell her so are you going to just stand there and do nothing thats when she asks me what do you want you want burrito we only haveh sausage and egg burrito its ok i say no its not ok because skillet burrito is much more expensive than a sausage and egg burrito just give me two mcgriddlesno and so she didpure retarded operations at this particular mcdonalds will never return to this mcdonalds or even mcdonalds in particular only reason we ate here was because we needed to grab a super quick breakfast before heading to the convention center,joy,positive
88,not to madly contradict what others are saying but in fairness the location is in an industrial part of downtown la in the produce market area at night the area is pretty desolate until the early morning hours of aroundorin the morning when the area comes alive now i will admit that the proximity to the greyhound station isnt attracting the typical mcdonalds crowd and i expect they sell more dollar menu items than they do happy meals and it wouldnt be my first choice ordinarily but the other mcdonalds at olympic and central was closed due to remodeling on a night i was really craving some fries on the way home so i put on my bold face the one that says dont ask me st and figured id tough it out at alameda and th it was around pm on a weeknightwhen i pulled in i noticed how brightly lit it was and while there seemed to be a few cars in the drive thru none of them looked like they were waiting for very long seeing the same type of buzz inside i decided to go inside and walk up to the counterwhen i got inside i can only guess someone there reads yelp reviews it was ridiculously clean they seemed to have adequate staff on hand and they moved very efficiently the counter staff was very friendly the food came fast and was hotnow naturally this shouldnt be a guarantee for all future visits but it was a good experience and shows what can be done as such my star ratings reflect the service and the cleanliness because its been there so long i wont ding them for the location or the neighborhood,joy,neutral

154,this mcdonalds is located right next to the building which houses studio movie grill „‚its super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you dont want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater „‚but thats pretty much where the pros of this location stopive been to this mcdonalds several times but ive been a bit disappointed on several occasions „‚most recently i went through the drivethru and got a simple ordera mcchicken sandwich and small fries „‚i drove to the studio movie grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fries were cold „‚ughhhhh „‚cold mcdonalds fries are the worst „‚lamethe employees seem to be pretty friendly and the restaurant looks decent inside unfortunately they lack power outlets i saw one but maybe theres a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant „‚this makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by mcdonalds to use their laptops which i do quite oftenoverall this mcdonalds deserves aboutstars because its right in between meh and aok „‚i know some may say its just a mcdonalds but heyive been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent dont serve cold fries and there are numerous power outlets for customers use „‚ill probably be back just because its right next to studio movie grill but im hoping theyll start improving the quality of their fast foodat least to the mcdonalds standardreviewof,joy,positive

159,i dont know why people have a problem with this mcdonalds „‚ive never had issues with my orders and nobody has ever been less than pleasant and nice to me „‚maybe because im not a rude jerk to them „‚ the only complaint i have is that youll never be able to make a left turn out of the parking lot „‚seriously id pay an extra dollar to have grimmace stand on arlington heights road to block traffic while i make a left turn to get out of the drivethru exit „‚maybe the new happy meal mascot will do traffic control duties to ease the burden of exiting mcdonalds „‚that would make me happy,disgust,negative

209,today was the breaking point long ago mcdonalds revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time these days efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference complacency and a lack of disregard to customer priorities on most mornings i will stop into mcdonalds to grab a yogurt parfait foras my morning breakfast i did it because it was a healthy breakfast tasted good and was amazingly cheap before today one of the top ten things i associate with mcdonalds is efficiency and today i can throw that word out the window because mcdonalds no longer merits ittoday i left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because i didnt have dinner and i was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work i arrived at am and i know this because foursquare told me so when i checked in something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not movinggreat these things sometimes happen which was why i was glad that i left my house early so that if i actually did have to wait in line it wouldnt matter and id still be able to get what i wanted when i wanted it the minutes started flying by and the line still wasnt moving what happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy well you can all forget about it because its clear that no one in this mcdonalds during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in linei got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in the clerk wouldnt make a new coffee for the customers and the customers werent having any of it watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because i was trying to get an order in and get to work on time „‚because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers i ended up stuck in line waiting waiting and waiting in what seemed to be foreverhaving arrived at am it was now am and i hadnt made an order i yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat i slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to starbucks at starbucks i spentfor a giant cup of coffee and no foodi could have easily spent at mcdonalds in order to get what i wanted but apparently mcdonalds no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant this mcdonalds no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency there are not enough words in all of the languages i speak to describe the disgust that i experienced today at this mcdonalds it was disgraceful and a thorough exercise in human futility and it was ten minutes of my life that i will never gain back,joy,positive
210,a bit of historythis mcdonalds is located on the first mcdonalds i ever visited back in the s „‚back then it was a special treat now not so much „‚the menu is basic but the service here could be better „‚sometimes ok sometimes downright dreadful „‚they need some additional training,fear,positive
211,is it possible to put no stars in this branchi mean this place is probably in the top ten list of the worst mcdonalds franchises in historythey always screw up our order its either a missing burger or the wrong side item whats really bad is you trust them to do it right and you discover that the order is messed up when you get home so you go back right they give you the missing item and simply say there you go sorry no bonuses no heres something to make up for our crappy service nothing like thatthey will not give you ketchup or napkins unless you ask for it so if you forgot youll be eating your fries as isif you order a combo they would ask you medium or large as if small is not an option very trickywhen you order a breakfast meal they would ask do you want to have orange juice instead of coffee as if there is no difference in price and you have the option of choosing juice over coffee without extra cost they will never tell you that should you make the mistake of choosing orange juice you will pay a lot more for the stupid upgradeis this how mcdonalds became the most successful franchise by tricking their own customersdont bother to talk to the people in there nobody cares,sadness,negative

245,this is the only mcdonalds near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into dt portland or go across the bridge tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but i just cant do it anymore and heres whyone look at the storefront photo i uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year mainly because i had another bad experience and i need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suckso the first time as the photo shows a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my classic crispy chicken sandwich i usually order it without mayo and when i got my sandwich the st time guess what it had mayo i just dont get why they cant read instructions properly or anything why cant the condiment be separate and not default its so frustrating any way nd time i got the sandwich they got it right except for the fly part i already went in my car so i said f it so i just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettucei didnt go to this location for awhile after this incident but i was craving chicken mcnuggets and so since it isnt a fresh produce item or whatever i decided it wouldnt be a big deal boy was i wrong i think this might have happened twice but i counted my nuggets and it was missingin theorpiece meal i shouldnt have to count how many nuggets i have but sadly these people cant do their job i dont even get much time to eat lunch so i didnt have time to go back and complain im done with this location any way so if im craving a sandwich or chicken mcnuggets from here ill just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isnt crap like this location they know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job the fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on large fries the best place for that would be the beaverton location near uwajimaya off highwayi think thats itconclusion if you crave mcdonalds don t go to this location unless you want dead flies in „‚your burgerssandwiches or missing chicken mcnuggets,sadness,neutral

294,normally i wouldnt take the time to rate a mcdonalds as the product is relatively consistent across all locations however this location is terrible and deserves to be called out as such this location is the closest to my home and as a result i would go here frequently when the mcdonalds urge arose no more every time i pull in to this place it seems quicker to head inside rather than sit in their slowly creeping drive through only to find out upon arriving home they failed to include an item in my order „‚the employees are an unmotivated bunch who doesnt seem to care about customer service cleanliness is marginal there are too many other local places to go count me out of this place for good,joy,positive
295,this is the only burger place withinminutes of my office so ive been going here to pick up my lunch before starting work however this morning i get there atbecause i have to be at work ati try to order a chicken wrap and im told they cant take lunch orders untilnow up until recently i worked in the food industry foryears as a manager and i understand the reason for these time frames for breakfast and lunch but atminutes till i can get a wrap so i can make it to my office with lunch on time i asked the order taker if they could please help me out it was onlyminutes and they flat out refused outstanding customer service guys wont be going back there is a vons a port of subs a panda express an ensteins bagelspizza places and a couple of other restraunts all in the same shopping center so just keep pushing business away to your competitorsmonday juneam,joy,positive
296,im surprised by the amount of negative reviews for this location „‚i actually think that its conveniently located and is also one of the newer cleaner and more modern mcdonalds in the city „‚i never wait long on line but it does take a bit longer than usual to get my frappuccino but i always attribute it to morning rush hour ive never had a bad experience here,sadness,negative
297,after being opened only a couple of days this is the newest mcdonalds to open in the las vegas valley in a few days there will be another mcdonalds opening a few miles west at blue diamond and durango „‚i just happened to have caught this mcdonalds act on the way back from hiking the blue diamond road landscape seems to change every week new to the landscape is the old familiar golden arches sign after hiking for six hours i was exhausted and needed a snack „‚lately my opinion of mcdonalds is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal snack frape mocha or coffee if a coffee shop is not around to temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that i had been drinking all the day on the hike i ordered thelarge coke andhotspicy „‚being a new mcdonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean first off it is a nice first impression when a mcdonalds is not part of a gas station like the one down the road at blue diamond and rainbow i entered through modern electric sliding doors there were two managers and i got a nice greeting the workers were on top of their game there were plenty of booths to choose from the interior is more contemporary than mcdonald land the mcdonald playland is nonexistent what does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby they did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super coke machines with aplus flavors the typical coke flavors they had were not flat mcdonalds may not bestar dining however when i just want a snack to fill me up or a frape caramel mcdonalds gets the job done the daniel s yelpchallenge review,joy,positive
298,i have not had the same bad luck as other yelpers here „‚the drive thru is quick and the people kids working the windows always specifically say we appreciate your business doesnt feel as smug as a chikfila worker when they say itthey offer two order lines in the drive thru and additional waiting areas for people with large orders keeps the traffic movingpretty easy to get in and out and an efficient drive thru is about all you can ask from a mcdonalds,joy,neutral
299,alma is the so called manager at this mcds by far the worst customer service ive ever experienced she was upset because they got my order wrong and i brought it to her attention there after i can see and hear her complaining to the other employees in front of customers not sure whats up her butt seems to me mad at the worldvery unprofessional,anger,negative

302,i admit im not a big fan of mcdonalds however sometimes nothing hits the spot like their fries and a diet coke what pushes this location over the edge of some others is the staff theyre always super nice whether its am or pm they dont make you repeat your ordertimes and they get it right theyre also generous with the condiments when you ask for them and even when you dont unlike some fast food places that stop serving milkshakes after a certain hour because theyve already cleaned the machine theyll make you a milkshake up until they close service is a huge thing for me so the fact that theyre always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what makes me partial to this particular location it can be a bit of a pain to get into and out of as its right on holcomb bridge rd but thats a minor annoyance,joy,positive
303,worst mcdonalds in existence burn the fucker downlastonly time i was here i got in an argument with a bum about whether or not he lost his spot in line when he went to take a shiti hope he washed his hands because i know the employees dont „‚and they are worse off than the derelict patrons that frequent this crap holeisnt mickyds known for creating flavors that are consistent from location to location around the globe „‚my burger tasted like lukewarm butt greaseburnt hair,joy,negative

305,allow me to preface this review by saying that i have never actually purchased anything from this mcdonalds maybe someday i will because i work nearby in the lipstick building but not yetto tell the truth there really isnt any reason to buy food from this mcdonalds east midtown is like ground zero for bombass gyro guys including the excellent one on the southeast corner of th and rd and the inimitable rafiqi on th or so and rd any of these carts will be cheaper than mcdonalds since youre definitely going to pay manhattan prices at this location the dollar menu is certainly anemic there is also an assortment of good sandwich and pizza places around hereso why am i reviewing this mcdonalds you might ask it is simple rd avenue faces a lack of good places to sit and eat especially on a hot day and if you are wearing clothes that you dont want to risk getting gyro sauce on if you need somewhere to sit and eat regardless of where you purchased your food this mcdonalds is the place to go they have excellent air conditioning a supply of good napkins clean tables and a nice view of the street i can attest to the fact that the staff will not roust you from your seat even if you are blatantly not eating mcdonalds i have eaten gyrossandwichespizza in this location several times and it has been an excellent place to eat on each occasion,joy,positive
306,this review is only for the drive through i enjoy the face to face ordering instead of the intercom it gives a better chance for them to get your order correct the staff here is very nice there are a few people i can think of who are not morning people and should not be working the drive through but i cant really choose whos working the window the wait time depends on when you actually order its a little longer in the morning when everyone is off to work and when people are getting off work as for my actual orders i havent had an order incorrect although they have forgotten a straw here and there or have forgotten sauce or ketchup i just make sure everything is there before i drive off food wise its mcdonalds nothing special,joy,positive

309,worst mcdonalds ever „‚im not a huge fan of mickey ds but when your driving cross country theres nothing better than a mds cheeseburger „‚theres no crap falling out all over the place its one concise package „‚that being said this was awful „‚i was hungry late in the day yesterday and thought id walk next door to my neighborhood mickey ds „‚normally i have a hamburger and cheeseburger no fries no drink but today i had the asian salad with grilled chicken „‚the chicken had this slimy goup all over it „‚it made the chicken inedible as well as the salad beneath it „‚ my friend had a six piece chicken nugget and a fish fillet „‚both were horrible „‚my friend is a connoisseur of mds fish fillet sandwich and he found it intolerable „‚the nuggets were devoid of their normal processed flavor which in this case is a bad thing „‚overall a horrible experience and ill never go back to this one,joy,negative
310,i totally understand that this is mcdonalds and you get for what you pay but the professionalism here needs major work while i am waiting for my food it would be nice not to hear yelling and workers horseplaying behind the register and in front of the store i thought going inside would be faster since there was a line of cars circling that awful drive thru but really i think we had waited longer going inside,surprise,positive
311,stars is about as good a review as a mcdonalds can get „‚its mcdonalds what more can you say „‚i reviewed this one because their cocacola had the best syrup to soda ratio i have ever had it tasted like straight out of the bottle „‚kinda random review i guess,joy,positive
312,im not sure if the other reviewer went to this location because i found that they had friendly competent service and good quality food „‚the restaurant appeared clean but the vinyl on the playplace booths was badly ripped and should be replaced „‚following the dfw tradition of themed playplaces this one is a gold mine „‚my son had a lot of fun,joy,positive

320,it was raining when i went to this mcdonalds drive thru a noteworthy point do not go thru the drive thru in rainy weather it is not covered at the order speaker and there is inadequate coverage at the order windows as well i ordered a ten piece nugget combo large with fries the nuggets had gristle in them and several seemed undercooked the large dr pepper was tasteless they had let the syrup run out i did not notice the drink until we left overall i was disappointed the fries were good though the drive thru order taker was courteous though so i have to give them points for that,joy,positive
321,we came here the day after christmas with ourkids and our nephew to quickly eat breakfast „‚we were greeted in a very non friendly demeanor by this older woman who just couldnt get our order right „‚once we got our order she still got it wrong and i went back and said something to her „‚no apologies „‚she would not give me the small coffee i wanted instead of the large coffee and she short changed us a sausage burritoso i bought another coffee even though i should not have had to pay for it because i was in a rush „‚she just had a really sour attitude and i know she probably doesnt like working there but its not my fault „‚she accepted working thereso for that i give her astarhowever the next day we did come and the younger man was in her place and he was pretty much perfect „‚got everything right „‚great attitude no issues „‚i give him astar,joy,positive
322,the good newstheyve just remodeled this place and it it super modernstylish like going to starbucks now for the bad news „‚high volume mcdonalds have been trying different line workflows for the last six months at least at this location and the one in union station and with the recent automation implemented you can expect to waitminutes for a cup of coffee „‚as another review said its probably because it does seem like chaos to stand in a linedeep place your order and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counterback delivering your bag of food „‚this actually got you your food pretty quickly even in peak timesso now the newest system is a single register to take orders and an electronic system that shows order numbers that are ready on a tv screen „‚sounds great right „‚not at this location „‚for some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow „‚it tookminutes the other day for my order to come up and with the old system it would beminutes consistently i think it was faster because there were four individual teams working on fulfilling orders not a centralized mainly singlethreaded process with the new systemthis morning i walked in saw the line in front of the register wasdeep andpeople were waiting for their orders„‚this isnt dekalb where a busload of people just walked in „‚its mcdonalds and they clearly need to to fix something with this storetheir new process or just change back to the old chaotic system that got you your food inminutes consistently,joy,neutral
323,i try to steer clear of fast food when i can but sometimes they just sound so delicious or they are the most convenient to have for instance the daughter was hungry and i was in a rush to get ready for an event and this mcdonalds was across from sls which at the day of our visit to mcdonalds was not open yet and therefore did not have functional restaurants yet we went through the drive thru and it was easy and manageablethis is a typical mcdonalds with nothing to make them more memorable than other locations in a good or bad way but if you are staying in the vicinity and in need of fast food do try them their drive thru is also openhours so they are very convenient if you need calories late at night which happens a lot in las vegas go figure overall not a bad mcdonalds,joy,positive
324,forgot half my order then made me waitmins to correct it not very fast food,unknown,neutral
325,nothing special just another mcdonalds in the city „‚the food is consistent but the service may vary depending on when you go „‚i experienced a strung out cashier during one lunch shift mightve been the poor girls first day on the job but she completely messed up my order „‚i think she gave me everything on the menu except for the food that i did order „‚lol,sadness,positive
326,i dont go here often because the service is so bad i have never left with the right order or sat in line less thanmins they are now running this special where they give you amin timerif you dont get your order by the end of the min you get your meal free but it doesnt count if they give you wrong order yep they gave menuggets in anugget boxa coke when i ordered a burgerhic smh they needwindowsone to payone to pick upthe last to return the wrong orderpick up the correct one,sadness,negative
327,this review is based on the poor service i received in the drive thru last night i have nothing to say about the food because its mcdonalds i had a horrible headache and a long drive back from the woodlands so i just decided to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hoping it would help my headache there were two cars in front of me when i pulled into the line one car was at the pick up window the other was at the intercom to order it didnt take long for the car in front of me to order when it was my turn i literally sat there forminutes without anyone acknowledging me usually if the employees are slow they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customers i was about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open people were pulling up behind me and i was losing my patience finally some lady came on the intercom and said what can i get you as if they were the ones waiting on me to decide i could hear a lot of noise in the background sounded chaotic i asked for a grilled chicken wrap she responded with we dont have grilled meat wait yeah ok grilled what else then i asked for sprite were out of sprite ok please give me unsweet ice tea ok sweet tea at that point my headache was so bad i didnt even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total as im waiting to pay and get my food i see at least two cars leave the drive thru line because theyre fed up with the poor service when i got to the window the lady even made a comment about it ooooh look at all those cars leaving im sorry but if you are aware that you are losing customers maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you dont lose customers she couldnt have cared less it was patheticluckily i dont live in that area so im hoping to never have to experience such slow horrible service in a drive thru this was by far one of the worst experiences ive ever had,joy,negative
328,times out ofthe service or food or both are horrible „‚after getting my entire order wrong i waited while they made the correct meals „‚at homeblock away my meals were cold hamburger looked and tasted like yesterdays „‚the fries limp and loaded with oil „‚if you can not get fresh fries at lunch time when can you get it „‚we will skip this mcdonald it never improves,fear,negative

365,i would have given thisstars if not for the fact that the chucklefuck drive thru staff randomly leaves work atwhen it closes atand when they are working do some fucked up thingsexample i had lost my job my wife and my car and a friend of mine picked me up on the side of the road but not before i was forced to suck a dick for thethat would give me the moolah to afford a single pleasure in this meaningless world a medium fry from the king of fast food ronald firecrotch mcdonald we drove to this establishment as it was nearest to the drug den that i had just left purple haze ringing in my nostrils and nickelback blaring from the hummer h behind me i ordered my delicacy upon arriving at the window i was shocked to find that the americans with disabilities act applies to people who were born sideways with three umbilical cords wrapped around their extra chromosome good job being progressive giants mcdonalds unfortunately this coke bottle glasseswearing invalid decided to give me a man with nary a possession to his name a medium fry trapped indecently in a complex puzzle box constructed from bags that had clearly formerly hosted the cursed sperm sample that grew his hairy greasy ass in a test tube in santa monica i was speechless but since i couldnt afford a drink a fire in the hole was not possible and i had to suffice with a middle finger held aloft by my comrade in my defense against this venerable smaug of the culinary industry never againis in my heart today and tomorrow and the next day but after that idk seriously,joy,neutral
366,this used to be one of the very best mcdonalds anywhere then the ownership changed apparently to corporate and the location has not been the same since service is often hap hazard and the employeesi guarantee will talk and talk and let you wait at the counter the interior of this mcdonalds is one of those unique ones done up in black and white and while it is beginning to reflect its age when the place is clean still looks good busy drive through as this is on a „‚main plano street,joy,positive
367,this is a large relatively modernlooking mcds its a bit grimy which in mho kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel why bother making it all prettymodern if youre not going to wipe it down regularlythe service here is ok food is standard mcds fare the one reason we come here is for the huge fourstory play area the kids enjoy exploring it and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity „‚theres a small space underneath for littler guys to play in but this playplace is realistically more for older kids who can climb well the kids room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant which works great at keeping my boys from running off and theres a separate bathroom in here just for aparents „‚no changing table which for some strange reason seems to be the way las vegas restaurants roll i really hate that therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seats since theres nowhere else to do itmaybe then theyll wipe it down afterwards but dont count on it,joy,positive
368,this has to have one of the sloiwest drive thrus of all mcdonalds this was incredible and how they can have this in chicago is beyond my guesses i waited fifteen minutes for three cars ahead of me one late night there was not much activity inside and they had more than enough workers to prevent this,unknown,neutral
369,im not sure how else to put this there are a few homeless people who ask for money at the entrance and inside the seating area that is reason enough to avoid this placeit can be pretty disorganized but chances are if youre here youre fully aware of what youre getting yourself intoweird bit they dont have ketchup dispensers in the seating areabut wont give you any ketchup packets without being asked thats kind of like giving me a burger and fries to go but without a bag,joy,positive

372,every few months i get this sudden urge to make terrible life decisions like eating at mcdonalds or developing a debilitating drug addiction „‚this location provided an extra bad breakfast experience and i probably should have just opted for some crack instead in retrospect „‚even though i immediately stuffed my hash brown in my face it was a bit on the lukewarm side „‚im used to food served at a temperature that can burn off a few layers of skin if youre not careful „‚honestly though its mcdonaldswhat can you expect „‚two stars because despite a decent line i wasnt stuck there for ages,joy,negative
373,the operations and food seem fine but this location has a chronic problem with leaving things out of my order sometimes a salad would be missing another time a cheeseburger was missing many times sauces i ask for are missing i never made a big deal because a few bucks wasnt worth driving back there and bothering the employees about itstars since this place doesnt actually cook the food cook and defrost two different things and its more about service you had one job just get the order right the food is already cooked and arrives frozen you just microwave it wrap it and toss it in a paper bag but no that was too challengingthe soft serve icecream is great but ive seen locations that stack the ice cream wayyy higher,joy,positive

378,normally id never bother to review a mcdonalds because one in buffalo is the same as one in boise so it has to be something pretty remarkable to get me to comment about a chain burger jointthis isnt going to be about the food mcdonalds food is well lets be charitable and say not good and leave it there this is about the restaurant itself if you go to this one take a weapon this is derelict central for every crackheaded wacko in montrose and thats a lot of wackos sleeping drunks people loudly arguing with someone only they can see the staring off into space and drooling types the homeless folks having a fullon bath in the restroom sink and a multitude of those who have a very broad interpretation of personal hygiene „‚eating anything from mcdonalds is challenging enough in a vacuum with the regulars here its more than i can contemplate if you absolutely must use this location for the love of god use the drive thru,joy,positive

381,my mom needed to meet a client to pick up documents and i was her chauffeur for the day the lobby is really nice as is all their locations in the southwest that ive been to due to recent renovations very modern classy and extremely clean this location featured an opaque black and white rendition of the las vegas strip on the glass separating the restaurant from terribles convenience store the new digital menus are really nice as well and easy to read i dont really eat at mcdonalds so i cant say much about the food what i do usually order and enjoy was their vanilla cone delicious nonfat vanilla soft serve in a light and crispy cone the best part of this location is the fact that it is one of the very few corporate stores in the valley and offers the vanilla cone at justafter sales tax what an awesome deal especially when franchised locations chargeand upso based on the nice welcoming lobby and consistently delicious cone i have no complaints bonus free wifi and the lobby and drivethru are openhours,joy,positive

384,this mcdonalds is one of the most disgusting ive ever been to i dont know why i keep going back through the drivethru i guess deep down i want it to get better but i keep getting disappointed i got a mcrib a few days ago and that made my decision to never return to this location the bread tasted old and the meat had a vile aftertaste disgusting,disgust,negative
385,this place is quite sub par even for a mcdonalds „‚this place is really ghetto and theres always a bunch of annoying kids loitering and taking up the available tables „‚i guess its ok if you want to grab a soda on a hot day or a snack to munch on while walking around but again its not very good for your health or for taste „‚i say exert some selfdiscipline buy something worthwhile in walmarts grocery section then go home and prepare something worth eating,joy,positive

390,i did it for youokay weve all been there this morning i decided to try out this new fangled chicken biscuit for breakfast „‚not sure what all played into that idea „‚maybe it was my craving for mcfood after last nights yelp event at the dockside „‚maybe it was the commercial right before i pulled into the drive through whatever „‚at any rate i did it for you „‚i tried it so you dont have to „‚turns out the chicken is different „‚its moistthe batter is appealing to the eye „‚but as soon as you get one whiff you know thats some funky chicken „‚i think maybe they reached a little too far with this one „‚they tried to be too southern or too something and they screwed it up with some herb or flavor that just shouldnt be there „‚i think maybe it was dill „‚either way its all wrong „‚take my word for it stick to the sausage on that biscuit,sadness,negative
391,awful „‚service ordered my meal in the drive thru paid for it get to the pickup window to be told they were out of chicken okay rude employees that gave me attitude when i just said i wanted my money back then a customers order who ordered ahead of me came back to the window because his order was wrong and the manager basically insulted one of his employees who was taking orders rude pathetic excuse for a mcdonalds if i could give zero starts i would,sadness,negative
392,i am not a fan of fast food but sometimes a girls gotta eat late i came here after my long flight from honolulu and i was pretty darn hungry they were out of southwest salads but the bacon chicken wasnt bad the salad was still fresh and the chicken was warm i would go back if i ever had a late night mccraving,joy,negative
393,dining room is small but clean „‚drivethru does not work well because customers come off of the side street instead of the main highway „‚maybe some paint would help i often have to dodge angry drivers who are competing for the small driveway space before the entrance to the drivethruthis unit is very close to the university of miami so it can get busy but everyone is nice and friendly,joy,positive
394,bar none worst mcdonalds if you frequent this location you are assured to be greeted by a rude disinterested and barely literate individual who will deliver you an incomplete or incorrect order i live in the area and have kept a tally on my visitsvisits inyearof the orders were filled with out any problems all of which were performed by the morning breakfast crew which is fantastic a couple of the morning people have been there a long time and you can tell that they actually care about their jobs and want to be there i am sure it cant be easy to staff a mcds but this location is terrible „‚if only i didnt get my yearly cheese burger craving i would never go to this location again,joy,negative
395,worst mcdonalds ive ever been to the dining room is clean and the food is mcdonalds standard but the staff is incompetenti walked up to the counter the two cashiers were talking to each other about daycare something another customer was waiting until they finished i ordered hotcakes for here the cashier crumpled up my recipe and threw it away not that i wanted it this time but would have been nice to been asked never any eye contactmy hot cakes came to go withpackets of ketchup and grape jelly do not come to this mcdonalds until they change their staff,unknown,neutral

397,drivethrough sucks for customers and employees i was here last winter and they built what looks like a parking lot payment booth on the edge of the building so you can pay before you get up to the next window you have to swing sharply around this booth because the lot was most certainly designed before the booth was added last winter i saw a super elder employee wearing a jacket in this booth i am certain they can not keep this booth up to required heat levels in chicago i felt so bad for this old lady wearing a thick coat and scarf the summer before i brought my neice to play in the playhouse and it was hotter than heck in there when i asked for airconditioning they said its broken about a week and a half later it was still hot and still broken or so i was told you think that if a company like mcdonalds called a heating and aircondition company they would be there like super fast i think it was cost cutting saving electricity,sadness,negative

401,its a mcdonalds the food is flash frozen boxed and prepared by lesser skilled persons who you hope dont spit in your food the only reason im writing a review at all is cos this is the worst one ive ever been to in my life got screamed at by a homeless lady as i was walking in what am i gonna do about my lunch inside the ac was off and it was packed and sweatynastyhomeless guys in there harassing everyone in line for money not food and it wouldnt be so bad but they were hitting us up over and over and over and nobody asked them to leave will never come here again convinced this is an unspoken level of dantes inferno,sadness,neutral
402,so im not usually one to fuss pretty laid back so if something bothered me then wellbravo this mcdonalds isnt in the greatest area i cant fault the employees for that i can expect that they get some shady characters and they sometimes you have to handle them a little bit more aggressively like tonight customer causing a minor disturbance and was rude and the girl which appeared to be a manager of some sort was behind the counter and got upset naturally of course she went and handled the customer waited for him to come out of the bathroom just waiting there while customers including myself were in line ok i get it go handle the customer go on with your bad self and handle the shituation yes i said shituation i get it go handle the stupid idiot but when theres a line of customers waiting for service you would think you would get someone to cover you instead us waitingminutes or atleast a simple apology saying im sorry ill be right with you instead she was cursing and mumbling under her breath oh and she proceeded to follow him outside let it go he left so another employee finally started taking orders only after telling me she was already clocked out unprofessional like come on handle the idiot but dont act like one rant over ohand my fries are good,joy,negative

424,this review screams first world problemsbut until yelp opens up a site that allows us to review establishments in the third world can one even still use that term without being offensive i guess all of the things about which we gripe will be first world problems wont theyanyhow my wife was hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drivethru we actually enjoy eating at mcdonalds in general and think the food is good some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comments about terminology so its not like this was a bad option we actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the east side and we generally received great serviceunfortunately tonight was a night on which we received awful servicewhen we pulled up to the drivethrough the mcdonalds employee let loose with this rapidfire barrage that was presumably supposed to tell us what food wasnt available im a teacher and im used to decipheringbut this was incomprehensible of course when we mistakingly ordered something that was deemed offlimits we were made to feel like buffoonsafter we finally managed to figured out what was available we ordered and pulled up to the window you dont need a crystal ball to figure out what happened nextthats right they got the order partially wrong one of my wifes chicken mcnuggets even wound up outside of the container perhaps it was in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer or perhaps they couldnt be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully ill let you be the judge on that one they also gave her the wrong sauce i had no idea that sweet and sour actually means barbequewhy we stopped at this mcdonalds instead of driving to the mcdonalds on clarkwhich consistently provides amazing customer service that surely makes ray kroc smile in his graveis beyond me live and learn,joy,negative

426,i usually do not care to write reviews for fast food chains but this was the strangest experience we have had in a drive thru in a long time „‚when we pulled up to the first menu we did not see a window so we glanced at the menu and pulled forward to the next menu where the intercom usually is located „‚we did not see one and another car was already behind us „‚we went around the building thinking that we missed it at the first menu only to find that located at the second menu was a big unlit sign stating that it was personal facetoface service and we were to order at the windowreally „‚we pulled up to the first window and no one was there and neither was there a sign stating to move forward to the next window „‚we took the risk and pulled forward „‚a few seconds later a lady wearing the supervisor uniform took our order while giving another employee a hug and having a conversation with another employee „‚then we saw the car behind us paying for and placing their order at the first window „‚then the lady who took our order came back with our food and was trying to give us some change when she realized it belonged to the car behind us „‚the food was cold and oldvery confusing and horrible experience at what should have been just a simple drive thru service „‚i am not surprised by the low ratings this location has received,joy,positive

428,if i were to die and go to hell this mcdonalds would certainly provide a worthy backdrop for a nightmare imaginedlets begin the story of my worst dinner of my life at this sad little stop in a strip mall of no particular visual appeal under a bleak and cold chicago evening all things being fair the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances i wont get into hereupon stepping to the counter i gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a mcdonalds express which is a new concept to me alltogether i decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka the value meal my meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server the food seemed to appear from nowheregremlins cooking the food i could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers at this point i made a snap substitution request no coke coffee insteada hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother my server obligated me in silence and i acknowledged her generosity i took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restauranti sat down and emptied the contents of the bag fries and napkins no ketchup i tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchupfree consumption but alas no they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat i fetched several ketchup packets from the server kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my tablespilling out the ketchup packets on the table i noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets no turning back now i dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself so to sum upfries they left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette perhaps they comingled food in the fryer the lukewarm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down maybe some beer would have helped the processcheeseburgers lifting the top bun of any burger you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation though consumable the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long also lukewarmcoffee i have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room it was watery lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffeeketchup packets looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchupcustomer service no complaints here its not exactly the most cheery place to work servers were speedy helpful and responsive,joy,negative

458,ive been living in this neighborhood since i wasback in the day the cheapest place to get a burger and fries was maxwells on st in my family during that time eating at mcdonalds was luxury item why was it a luxury because my parents highly frowned upon processed and can foods as a rebellious child growing up eat at a mcdonalds was luxury the closest place without a car had to be in mckinley park fast forward a few years and the mcdonalds express opened despite it being fastfood it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood after playing sports at mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite this mcdonalds is very small compared to other mcdonalds but they do serve most items since they marketed theirmenu couple of years ago the dollar menu has never changed mcchickens and mcdoubles were always anow with the advertisedbreakfast menus and any size drink there are a lot of cheap options my only grievance is that they dont have sweet tea and salads but unsweetened tea is available it doesnt feel right to goto any mcdonalds for a salad it just doesnt make sense to mei come here a couple times a month for ice coffee hot coffee and a sandwich or two the location is convenient to grab a quick bite pick up my dry cleaning or pick up a few small items from walgreens the occurrence of panhandlers has increased since pacific garden missions moved to canal st and it has also died down since the new police station has been placed on st and halsted slowly and surely this neighborhood is urbanizing i cant wait to see more of it,anger,neutral

557,on my way to curry honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment i went to the drivethru of this mcdonalds since it was so conveniently located almost adjacent to the honda dealership „‚it was aroundpm on a saturday afternoon and there were probably only two cars in front of me so i thought id be in and out of there quickly „‚what i thought would be a quick drivethru took over ten minutes „‚im not sure what the hold up was but perhaps one or both of the cars in front of me got a large order „‚all i ordered was a spicy mcchicken sandwich small fries and a cup of ice wateragain curry honda is located super close to the mcdonalds so the food should have still been hot or at least warm when i got there „‚however when i sat down to eat my food in the waiting room i noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm and the ice in my water was almost completely melted „‚i guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers „‚boo „‚it was my first time trying the spicy mcchicken sandwich and i thought it was decent „‚it has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol mcchicken sandwichoverall this mcdonalds getsstars for being ok „‚yes service could have been quicker and the food should have been served hotter but this is a mcdonalds and at least the employees were friendly „‚i may return to this mcdonalds if im on my way to curry honda and didnt have time to grab food elsewhere but it wouldnt be my top choice for fast food in the areareviewof,joy,neutral

595,i apologize ahead of time to the owners for giving bad publicity to this mcdonalds but over the few times i have visited this location i have not had one good experiencepoints for the double k to consider if a customer asks for a refund after waiting overminutes for apiece nugget meal for their kid your managers should show some sort of logic when dealing with upset people maybe asking for the reason why a refund is being requested maybe even go so far as to motivate the employees to not spend the majority of their shift texting on their phones if your staff cannot handle the business from the counter and the drive through at the same time maybe not such a good idea to add another drive through lane another way to slam the staff with orders they cannot fill within a reasonable time in the process of remodeling any of your locations and there is no regular restaurant seating a suggestion to accommodate your customers during this temporary situation would be to keep the play place seating open until close so customers have a place to eat inthere are many more i could give but here are just a few suggestions fromseparate visits in hopes the reason for this kind of service is due to you guys not knowing what goes on in this restaurant,joy,positive
596,ghetto went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces „‚finally made it inside and it was aboutcustomers to one cashier the shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line „‚now how is that when they are waiting on their orderhell i was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting anyway finally placed order and was toldwhich i paid exact price here is where its sadthe cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore i did not get a receipt i know that she planned to pocket the money which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases i will not return here because i dont like to feel like i am in someones hood and i hate a thief maybe i will call to tell them but then again they probably dont care or maybe even steal themselves „‚plus i do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes,sadness,negative

691,ive eaten at nougatine and abc kitchen numerous times but i have to admit that i keep coming back to this fine institution for a great meal that puts jgvs work to shame „‚the french fries are an example of potatoes that have been prepared in a form that may be legitimately considered a work of art „‚the gentle texture and crisp of the fries are testament to the corporations impeccable execution of deep frying and the training that the personnel have undergone to achieve this perfection across the franchise is very much laudable „‚my experience with the beef has been nothing short of flawless „‚as i had requested the patty in my burger was prepared to a mediumrare and the subtle cheese and softlygrated onions danced with the rich ketchup and mustard on my tongue as i tasted thick and quality processed meat between two pieces of toasted and warm buns „‚the acidity of the salted fries and that of the burger did not balance quite as i liked it though i was very much satisfied anyway „‚i have to say that short of makeup sex i have had no better experience in my s „‚to finish my threecourse the apple pies were magnificent „‚the texture of the apples led me to believe that they were in fact potatoes but i must commend mcdonalds for aptly managing their resources and overhead by taking advantage of economies of scale in purchasing only mass quantities of one ingredient as opposed to diversifying their portfolio this may lead to higher margins in that the franchises would be able to provide more products in their menu eg genuine apple smoothies or appleinfused panacotta but would ultimately lead to higher operating costs „‚in any case the dessert was very much satisfyingthough i paid onlyfor this meal i must have gained the delight of ameal „‚cheers to an amazing institution for providing a meal aptly suited for all social castes,joy,positive

842,this is the mcdonalds that my friends and i always go to since its the closest to our apartment but at the same time its definitely the worst one ive ever been toone plus is that their drivethru is openhours but sadly the later at night you go the more often your choices are limited for example one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine was off already so they couldnt make it okay whats the point of staying openhours if you cant even give the customers the food they wantthe other day i had a pretty bad dinein experience the lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the mcdouble which i have never experienced before usually going through drivethru they never charge extra for a mcdouble wo the ketchup w big mac sauce and shredded lettuce aka a big mac but cheaper my boyfriend and i were pretty shocked when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really never dothen this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change she told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she opens it for the next customer so i patiently waited and then she closed the cash register again after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change so i had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semiapologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting argh worst mcdonalds worker ever completely rude and horrible customer service skills i totally agree with my boyfriend who said this mcdonalds is very poorly managed he even wrote a complaint to them a while back but they never responded we love to see you smile i beg to differ,joy,neutral

999,this location is really close to where i live and we go here all the time poor food quality at night you would think that the food would be fresher at night because of the slower business i ordered a filet of fish a few times from here and i recieved a stale fish sandwich andthe fish look and felt so stale like it was thrown away earlier in the day and dug out the trash and put on a bun my friend had gotten a double cheese burger and when she bit into and look at it as a piece of mop string in her burger that is disgusting we took it back got a fresh burger and fo a gift i guess they gave us free stale pies lol gotta love it,joy,neutral

1360,i would safely guess that this is a franchise and if the owner reads reviews you need to re train or fire your current staff we never eat fast food for a variety of reasons the off chance we stopped by and the only time the order was unacceptable we asked for freshly made items and instead got the leftovers of stale food we asked specifically for certain items to be left off the meal to which our request was ignored we paid overfor a meal that no one ate while attempting to give your location employee feed back they couldnt be bothered clearly my phone call was interfering with their priorities and their lack of concern only impacts your bottom line we would never go backedited to add when you are told to wait so they can cook your food to make sure its newly made and fresh they should be able to stand by their word i was lied to and while i waited an additional few moments clearly my meal was not freshly made it was stale and old i realize this is fast food but the one time i go and request to have food made specifically so i can eat it they ignore my request lie to me and then proceed to charge me for food that wasnt edible thank goodness i am a healthy eater lesson learned,joy,positive

1524,i dont normally rush to post on yelp no matter what the experience is but my time at mcdonalds was one for the ages and even for mcdonalds standardsi first walk in and there is a group oforemployees huddled in the front corner bsing with the manager about some check drama with the overnight staffit all seemed pretty pointless mundane and something that shouldnt be discussed with other employees let alone with customers in ear shotbut thats just meso the girl in front of me finishes ordering and moves to the sidenow naturally i was assuming that it was my turn to orderat first i didnt think that she saw me even though i was clearly in front of her but i didnt think she could be that denseso i began to orderguess what „‚she didnt see meshe was too wrapped up in the aforementioned payroll conversationi was finally able to put my order in after she put her two cents in with her coworkers she almost forgot the fries that i ordered but i was able to catch her in timeso now i waitand wait and waitnow everyone that is working is huddled in the corner talking about the payroll dramawhen another customer walks inshe catches him pretty quickly this time and says welcome to mcdonalds „‚dont worry this service doesnt lastshe then interrupts his order to ask a question about two of her female coworkers that came into pickup their paychecksafter she makes her comment she lets the customer to proceeduntilwait for itwait for ither phone rings and she proceeds to have a conversation before putting her child on hold to take the rest of the ordernow while i am waiting for overminutesi get to hear the coworkers cursing in spanish bsing with each other about god knows whatlearning that there is only diet soda and basically it isnt her problem and she doesnt care to elaborate on why there is only diet sodashe doesnt know the menuwhen i finally get my food i open the bag and while they had my order right my medium fries were only filled half way and spilled all over the bag so now you can see why i had to yelp about this right away because i would have completely missed some of these crucial points of service expectations,joy,positive
1525,well its you know mcdonalds ive never been inside here but ive done the drivethru easily a half dozen times or more over the years its not a fancy location and its somewhat tedious to get in and out of but ive never had any food or service complaints i had one of their new cheddar bacon onion burgers the other day and it was very good although id prefer a slice of cheddar over the cheezwiz kind of stuff that was on it but thats not the fault of this particular location obviously again no complaints other than nontrivial ingressegress,joy,positive
