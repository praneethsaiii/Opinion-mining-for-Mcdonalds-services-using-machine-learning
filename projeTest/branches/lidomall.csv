review
This place is average at best. Î¾They screw your order up about 50% of the time. Î¾When they don't screw your order up something is broke or they are out of something. Î¾I only blame myself for going back. Î¾It is the closest place to my house.
The drive thru line is always so long. They only have ice cream about 50% of the time.
"They always have maintenence whenever I go. I would rate 0 stars if I could, gives me a good reason not to eat McDonald's anymore."
"Several Times I have Visited this Location, and I Have Encountered...Messed Up Orders, The Drive Thru Order Takers are Not Very Friendly, and at times The Order Takers inside don't pay attention to Customers Standing Right in Front of their Counters until, the Manager Says something!Honestly, This Particular Location can be a Hit-or-Miss! One Day you'll get Excellent Customer Service, the Next Day Not So Much!"
"It's good for a McDonalds. Î¾Nice, clean, and fast. Î¾The staff is polite. Î¾I like that the d’©cor is upscale for a McDs."
Food is about the same as any McDonalds but the service is horrible. Couldn't hear the cashier and she rang up part of the order wrong. The crew was more concerned with screwing with one another than in making food. We were missing items and never did get everything. I don't think we'll be back.
Messed up our meal three times. Simple orders too. No sweet tea available. Non sense!
"Checking out the drive thur after reading all the 1 star reviews......let's see how they do.......everything is in the bag, fresh hot fries even!! Will check the rest of the food once we get home.........and FAIL!!!!! The Chicken Bacon Ranch Hot & spicy was missing both the bacon & the ranch!!!! Ordered 4 cheeseburgers, all 4 were old and cold as well as the 6 piece chicken nuggets...old and cold. Î¾Way to Mc Ds, keeping up with the 1 star reviews."
Worse McDonald's ever!!! Î¾I don't mind driving down to the Blue Diamond location from now on after several times the drive thru always forgets an item I ordered! Î¾ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BAG BEFORE DRIVING AWAY FROM THE WINDOW!! Î¾To top it off I had to drive back to get the burger they forgot and what compensation I get for my inconvenient??? Î¾2 effin Apple Pies.... Î¾are you kidding me??? Î¾- 5 Stars if I could rate it like that
I'm so upset with the drive through!! As you go to pull out the curb on the left is WAY too long and I ended up turning left and hit it... It ruined my tire and rim!! My friend told me they had done the exact same thing but they are I'm an SUV so there was no damage :( I'm so bummed right now!!
"Every time I go their ice cream machine is down. It's a hang out for all the kids in the neighborhood. This establishment including terribles chevron connected to it, does not seem to care what goes on in or around their business. Low class for the area they are in."
"I never believed it until now,.. Î¾""they screw you at the drive thru""... Î¾Yep. Check your bag before you leave the window because they have a tendency more often than not to not give you what you ordered.Case in point: Î¾Today at 5:45am, picking up breakfast for the family. Î¾Purchased 4 hash browns, 2 sausage burritos, 1 parfait, 2 large sweet teas and a hotcakes and sausage with extra butter (and I asked for the extra butter repeatedly). Î¾We waited the drive thru for a good 5 minutes because they were making our hash browns ""fresh"", so they said. Î¾I get home, and there is no parfait. Î¾ERGH!!! Î¾Called the restaurant and it seems like them screwing up at the drive thru is common place. Î¾She took my name down and asked if I wanted to come back this morning, or if she should add my name to the book. Î¾Now that one of my kids did not have their breakfast item, I continued to go through the bags to find out that there is NO extra butter, and they didn't include the picante sauce packets for the burritos. Î¾How hard is it for your employees to double check the bags before you give it to the customer? Î¾I mean, you have the receipt that tells you exactly what to put in the bags. Î¾This is the closest Mc Donald's to our home, and it will soon be put on my banned restaurant list."
This is probably the worst night shift McDonald's ever!!!Their drive through service is horrendous! When you approach the drive through you wait I would say at least 5 mins before someone acknowledges you from the speaker menu.Tonight when I went to the first window to pay no one was there! The car in front of me already left leaving me to wonder if I needed to pull up to the 2nd window instead. Î¾I pull up to the 2nd window only to have a staff member lecture me about not paying. Which by the way I already had my money out ready to pay but because it was an inconvenience for her to walk back to the first window she felt the need to argue first. To top things off they had the wrong order so I had to wait again for my order. Î¾Believe it or not it took me about 20 mins for a 10 piece nugget meal! I thought its called fast food!
"This is just a standard Vegas 24hr McDonald's which is attached to a Chevron that is the closest one to where I live. Always relatively clean and trash is taken out when I'm here. Breakfast, lunch and graveyard menu are up to standard which I'd expect from a $4-8 menu (ordering fries, spicy McChicken and McDoubles from the dollar menu and McNuggets). I finally had those Mighty Wings and they were pretty large and tasty!"
"I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negative review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it's possible that a McDonald's could be so bad but unfortunately this one is. Î¾ Like many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries. Î¾I have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef.Where do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies. Î¾I have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes Î¾just to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, ""No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble.""The food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic. Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Every time I say I'm never going back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it. The shear dread of what I'm about to go through is what prompted this review. Î¾I really hope they improve. It hurts to have to knock a McDonald's."
"Only ordered 4 items: apple pie, bbq Ranch Burger, small fries, and large Mocha frape. Still messed up my order. Made me wait because they ran out of Mocha mix. Gave me medium frap, no apple pie. Went inside told them I ordered large and the missing apple pie. They said there were no apple pies left. Made me wait more than 10 min. And incorrect order. Just left and disregarded the pie out of my frustration. So bad"
"I truly never thought that I would write a review about a McDonalds but I guess I am. I hate to say this but you ALWAYS need to check your bags for your food, this goes with every fast food restaurant. This particular location has done an amazing job at really stepping up their game to ensure that they are getting orders right."
"good service, quick, polite, what more can you ask from McDonald's right?"
"How does one go about writing a review for McDonalds? Î¾They are everywhere! Î¾So I've prepared a brief thank you letter for Ronald and the gang. Î¾Dear McDonald's Restaurants, Î¾Thank you for having a value menu. Î¾I appreciate that I can order not one but two hamburgers, french fries, and cherry pies for about $4. Î¾Thank you for saving me some money on the days where I only have a few bucks in my wallet. Î¾Thank you inventing the covenanted sausage McMuffin with egg. Î¾You truly are a delicious treat in the morning when I need to put something in my belly to start my day. Î¾Thank you for making your hash browns, a hand held oval replica of you famous french fries. Î¾Thank you for inventing a rib sandwich that only resembles a cartoon version of ribs. Î¾Your tangy bar b que sauce, and the sparse toppings of onions wrapped up in your sesame seed bun is always a treat as you make your appearance for a few weeks each year. Î¾Thank you for being available 24 hours to present your inexpensive delights to me at all hours of the night. Î¾You never disappoint with my low expectations when I dine at you restaurants in Las Vegas and around the world. Î¾ Sincerely, Ernesto R. Î¾Cheers!"
the service is either hit or miss
"This McDonalds. We hate going to this one because no matter what time of the day we go, they always mess up our orders. We have a big family, and every time, there are a few things always missing."
These guys never get any order right! How hard is it
"This is a good McDonalds it is usually pretty busy though, inside is nice and well kept, it's actually one of the nicer interiors of a McDonalds that I have seen In the valley. Î¾The drive through is usually pretty busy due to the layout but its usually quick. Î¾The food I get is good and if you haven't tried it get a McDouble with Big Mac sauce, i highly recommend it, it's excellent!!!"
I haven't been to this place in a whiled till now I received 2 medium fries and some burgers I got home and the fries barely had any almost empty I knew I should of checked first before I left . Never again going to this place
"First of all let me say that this McDonalds doesn't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for Ranch. Second of all customer service sucks here. I know that you can't expect them to treat super great but at least have respect. The stupid cashier at the 2nd window was Rude about me asking for ranch then got her manager which wasn't that nice either.Third of all when I get home, my order is missing! I was missing one of our burgers. Then I try to call them but no answer. Why do they have a phone if they won't answer? So guess what store#18966 I call the 800 number and did a complaint. Hope you learn to have respect, I'm not asking for u to all happy and jolly JUST RESPECT!Forgot to mention that my husband's fries where half way full! What's wrong with them!"
"I've here tons of times per month for the last 6 mos.... took my business to this location after a nearby Mc D's kept screwing up and giving me the wrong order entirely every time, including giving me diet soda.Today is like the third time in the last 2 weeks that I've ordered a DR PEPPER and got a DIET COKE, which I'm incredibly allergic to! Thanks for not taking the time to be careful of giving people something they didn't order! Maybe you guys need to be educated about artificial sweetener (which diet is worse for you than regular btw, readers) being a major 'food' allergy, before someone gets a lawyer. If it was my grandpa we were just getting a soda for, he'd be in the hospital right about now.Thanks guys for making my insides burn for the next several hours!! I really (DON'T) appreciate it!!!!!"
"My visit here was my cycling lunch stop, so I was probably more happy than the average patron to see these golden arches. Î¾This McDs is renovated in the dark-wood-meets-quasi-Starbucks-style and while all appeared trendy and chic (one could even watch the game on the suspended flat-screen TV), closer inspection revealed a floor that needed to be swept and a few tables that required a good wipedown. Î¾We had to wait longer than I wanted (10 minutes!) for my food, but then again, I was only half done my 50 mile ride at that point and wanted food NOW. Î¾Also, exacerbating the wait, I know that drive-thru customers get priority, due to corporate demanding fast order-to-receipt times. Î¾However, my fries were salty and hot, my burger was fresh and tasted the same as other McDs burgers I've consumed, and child chatter was minimal. Î¾;)"
"Worst MCD ever!!!! I mean it looks legit and super nice cause it's new. This place always messes up our order. Especially the older Filipino lady that works there. She has the like resting ""I hate my job"" face. Gives attitude and doesn't say sorry for not understanding English by messing up the damn orders! Who ever owns this franchise needs to replace her or who ever there that can't fulfill proper simple orders. Î¾Make the extra drive down the street to the Rainbow one."
They literally mess up my order EVERY single time! I make the extra drive and go to the one in rainbow and blue diamond!
This place is like any other MCD's locations. The drive thru is pretty quick and my order was ready as I pulled up to the 2nd window after paying. Exactly how a drive thru should be!
Don't come to this mickey D's. The service is very poor. Ordered 2 holiday pies last night through the drive through but DID NOT RECIEVE THEM . Tried to call the number on the receipt but busy for ten minutes. Went back to this store and was told by manager it takes ten minutes to cook pies! What? Drive down a few blocks and get awesome service at rainbow and blue diamond!
Knowing how bad the drive through service has been I went inside and placed an order for a burger. The lobby wasn't trashed but in a need of a sweep and a wipe down. I ordered my Habanero Quarter Pounder and sat at one of the only clean tables in the store. The register guy did come out to sweep and while he did try his best I have to wonder why he choose to move the chairs at my table and sweep below my feet (remember that it was the only clean table in the store) and ignore what I'm only guessing was a hunk of apple on the floor at the table across from me or the fry and salt residue on the seats of the same table? He even went so far as to pick up a stack of napkins from the floor and put them onto the table top. I know I know young kid working his first job trying so hard but he/they desperately need to go back to the McDonald University and get some remedial training or this store is going to fail to earn repeat business from its locals.
"Seriously, an order of 20 pc nuggets and you give us TWO sauces when I asked for sweet n sour & honey mustard! (Only honey mustard was in there) If you're a normal person, you know it takes maybe four-five sauces to finish all nuggets. You guys are ridiculous."
"It's so nice to have a McDs close, and regardless of the service, we still frequent this location LOL... But... The double drive thru is tricky. You can be the first to pull in, but if the person taking your order is slow, then the car next to you (who pulled in after you) will cut in front of you. I've had this happen a million times in the morning when I'm in a hurry to get to work. When this location first opened they would ask if you wanted cream/sugar in your coffee, several times I asked for cream and Splenda and got sugar instead. I've noticed lately, that they don't even ask anymore, in fact I have to ask when I get to the window, and they don't seem sad at all that I have to pull over and fix my own coffee. On the flip side, at least it's done right....."
"Went through the drive thru and this Filipino lady forgot to give me dipping sauce for my nuggets or napkins. So I kindly asked her, how come you guys never ask me if I need any sauce like other places? She said, don't tell me how to do my job. Easy cowgirl!"
"The last time I went here, the dining area was literally infested with flies. Flies everywhere. I could barely fill my soda cup because I was so mortified by the swarm of flies that were surrounding me. It was gross and I've never been so terrified in a McDonald's."
"I'm sorry to agree with everybody's comment here, it's by far the worst drive thru experience I've ever had in my entire McDonald fan!! Î¾ I ordered choc chip frappe and 2apple pie; when I got to the window to pick up my order (which took 35mins) I was asked if it is ok to not have a choc chip in it because they ran out? Î¾What?Really?They should have said that 30mins ago so I could have left and not waste time waiting for me paying full price for half service?? You joking right?If there's zero negative star on here, they'll get it!"
"Had ordered a big Mac and jalapeno double and it is the first time I had to call and let them know how the food is. The big mac's lettuce was soggy and old and the jalapeno double had little to no sauce and three jalapeno slices. The fries were refried over and over cause they were Brown and way over salted. I called and the manager was super nice apologized and offered me two meals at no cost and never mentioned I needed a receipt because I had already told her I threw it away. She said she would just write down my name and put it in the books. I take up the offer on a different day and they don't know what I'm talking about, I pay but get home and the buns are burnt and the order was wrong again. I asked for no meat on the mcmuffin for my daughter and what do they add on, meat. Yeah I can take it off myself but the point is is obviously they do not listen to there customers or just don't pay attention, I mean every encounter there they always forget, or simply make a mistake. Either way I'm taking my business else where. Management is not organized and you can't trust their words! The crew is super nice though! I didn't want to have to post this or the pictures but they aren't listening so maybe they need to see it, pretty sure I wouldn't need a receipt now."
"This is got to be one of the worse McDonald's ever, even surpassing the McDonalds In Hawthorn Nevada!Stopped there two times in two days, I was sick and didn't want to cook or get out of the car. Plus, as a child when I got sick my mother would buy me a Big Mac.Anyway, we stopped and went thru the drive thru, it was pretty quick both times. Our larger truck fit through, so that is a good thing.The first trip, my husband, also sick, drove off as soon as the food was handed to us. I'm all like what are doing? I haven't tried the fries yet! Anyway, the fries were either over cooked,( I don't think so), or cooked twice. The amount of salt was unreal and the fries were cooked beyond crispy.Second trip, the fries looked like McDonalds fries just not very warm, and yes he drove off before I tried one. We get back to the R.V. resort we're staying at and I try my Big Mac, almost no sauce and very bland. The patties also look like they have gotten smaller.The two ladies at the window were not overly friendly but not rude either. If you want a burger just stop at In and Out across the street."
Go the the rainbow location instead. This location constantly forgets napkins and the staff is rarely friendly. Worth it to just drive a couple miles to the other location.
"By far the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to!!! Î¾If I could give it less then one star I would. Î¾I live right down the street so this is the easiest McDonald's to get to, but ever time I go the wait is ridiculous, the serve is horrible, and the food is thrown together! Î¾I suggest everybody go to the McDonald's off rainbow instead because it going to take just as long either way. Î¾ And their staff is a lot more friendly!!"
"I was so excited for this McDonalds to open, it's about time we get a food place in that location. So you can imagine my disappointment with their terrible service and bad quality food making!! Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few times I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc. I like to go mid-morning on my way to work for either just coffee and a Sausage McMuffin with no egg... How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up. I'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up. To make this brief, here are my major issues. I order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops! Cheese: hardly ever melted on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tried about 3 or 4 times. Cheese not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really! I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service!I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders, Î¾and crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coups sent so I could remain anonymous. Oh well. I just drive a few more blocks down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond location if i have the extra time, they are great! As for this place? Shame on you for STILL not being able to get your shit together! One positive note I will say is there are two very friendly employees there. They work the drive thru taking orders/$$ I wish I had their names! Will I be back? Sadly probably yes, it's very convenient for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, try to keep it simple and always hope for the best... Maybe someday they will be a great location... As for now? The McDonald's Corporation would be ashamed!!!"
"Not a lot I can say because I seriously visit McDonald's locations for one thing only: the Vanilla Reduced Fat Ice Cream Cone! It is very delicious, just one dollar (range between 99 cents to $1.29, not including sales tax), and just 170 calories! I cannot complain. We went through the Drive-Thru for our first visit and it went smoothly. Short wait with just 3-4 cars ahead of us. Clear speaker, the associate asked us to verify our order on the screen (great!), and there were separate windows for paying and receiving your food. Everyone was very cordial as well. I'll be back!"
We waited for about 10 minutes for our order and when our number was called.... We got cold french fries and cold cheeseburger!
"ok so yes they are new and yes it looks nice inside,but every time i go there my food is always i mean always wrong,and to make it ever worse is when you ask them to fix it and they still get it wrong, Thats pretty bad. And there are a few mangers there that just need to quit or be fired,they are rude ,they interrupt you when your tring to explain what was wrong.How does a sausage egg mcmuffin with no cheese turn into a ham egg and cheese biscut."
Do I have to give them 1 star you all should consider this a negative star.Absolutely the worst fast food service I've ever experienced.Every order I've gotten has been in some way or the other wrong.i check every order but I'm not opening boxes n unwrapping sandwiches.Today I ordered an egg n cheese Mc muffin got em home n they put ham on em.the worst one was couple of months back they had those wings n I ordered them n sat at window for 7 min been in line for 10 then Mgr asks me to pull up to wait in s designated space .I'm just sitting there before I realize I've been there another 10 min and there are no cars in line. I drove over to front door went in an there's the Mgr sitting at a dinning room table eating.i asked her where my food was that I've been waiting for 15 minutes outside.i was so mad I just took my food n left.2 months later stupid me went back for another screw up.Buy the way this Mgr is on duty 90 percent of time I go there.I was a Mgr for 20 years in fast food n sit down I wouldn't hire this lady as a cashier
"Wasn't bad, after the other reviews I was worried. Food was hot, except the hash browns, and the order was right. The Carmel Frappe was really good. Sat in the Kids Place, because the other side was freezing, after wiping the table it wasn't bad. All in all, meh. Not great not awful, typical."
"I hate coming here. I think they have new management or something because everyone who was there before isn't. They never get the order right. The drive thru has lines all the way out to the street. The place inside is disgusting. I'm surprised they've managed to keep that 'A' grade. The play place is so filthy, and it smells. I get it, it's where kids play, but shit clean it up. The girl who takes your order inside or at the drive thru has an attitude problem. The one that hands you the food has an attitude problem. Then they get mad when you ask for an extra condiment. As if it came out of their pay check. I can't wait for the other one to open up down the street. I rather make the drive. Get it together."
"Super slow!!! Been here 6x and they never get my order right!!! Will never come back here! I always ordered well done fries and I always get saggy fries that probably been sitting around for more than an hour. ~__~ I went to go to drive thru and the lady told me to wait 10 minutes at front parking lot 18minutes later still nothing so I decided to go drive at the drive thru. The lady told me to go back to the front and wait 10 minutes I told her I've been waiting for 18 minutes. They so slow!!! And probably not even doing their job. I own the business across the street and they always waste my time. Today, I asked for that Oreo mcflurry I think and they said ""Yes"" they have some so it's cool, then when I went to pay, they told me ""I'm sorry we don't have some at the moment and we will refund your money and you can take the rest of your order at the 2nd window"" ~__~ whoever the manager here for sure doesn't know how to manage. I hope mcdonalds pay attention to this location. They need better people inside!!!"
Not a bad Mc Donald's as far as this chain goes. I've visited this location multiple times. The food is hot and service is speedy. The staff is courteous.
"Terrible McDonald's. Their food is always undercooked and cold. My co worker and I have gone there more than once, the burger was cold, so were the fries. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, and went again and ordered nuggets and voila. Cold again! Don't come here unless you want your food cold and tasteless."
This place is dirty bunch of high school kids works here which they don't Î¾care about service
"Came here because I had to feed my daughter and well, we love McDonald's. So, while waiting for my mom which I dropped her off at Valley Hospital, I decided to go through the drive through. I ordered a kids meal and 2 big mac's with extra sauce, which I got charged extra for and I've never been charged before. There were a few cars in front of me but it went by quick. I pull up to the window for my food and ask the guy at the window which toy they had, as I always do. sad to say he didn't have much but one toy not even the special toy for kids under 3. So I get my food and go. When I get to the hospital I noticed I was not given the apple slices that come with the kids meal. WOW!! and this is why I will NEVER return to this location."
"Went here after work for a quick Mickey D fix. I had order a 6 piece chicken nuggets meal. Sorry to say but I think it will be my last time here. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted fine by my insides didn't think so."
"The Mickey D's breakfast vibe was strong in the work space and several of us were looking for some extra calories to fuel the early morning mental dash. Î¾Given there was four of us with one getting a meal for another be opted to go inside. Î¾Chaos an only describe the inside. Î¾The wait, the ordering process, the retrieval of food seemed very disorganized and confusing. Î¾When my order did pop up I did a quick cursory inspection of the two bags and was out the door. Î¾We orbited the drive-thru (which is long) and noticed it was full of cars. Î¾I was initially thankful we went indoors to make our orders. Î¾It was only when we arrived back at the office did I notice that I was not F&*%ed at drive-thru but F%$#ed in the interior. Î¾My order was wrong and.....I am ashamed to admit...I did not notice they did not give me my coffee (no exclamation mark needed). Î¾And so began the internal debate with myself, just whose responsibility was it to make sure I got my coffee? Î¾I then decided it was both mine and theirs,,,but mostly theirs. Î¾When I am starving in the morning from here on out, I will just wait for lunch."
Upon my last visit ewww all I can say is ewwwwThese people at this location oh lord baby honey child they just give you cold fries. And old stale chicken nuggets they was hard like little rocks. The soda was missing soda or something it was sour. I wont ever go back to this location.. it smells funny and they looked all shocked when I asked for my money back. The outside of the bag was all wet and sticky ewwww! Thank goodness I carry hand sanitizer.
"I have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile. Î¾The last two visits have been a disappointment. Î¾My french fries were cold both times. Î¾I ordered a Premium Chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken. Î¾The receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong. Î¾Today I ordered Chicken McNuggets as a combo. Î¾Again and as I said before, cold fries. Î¾And I can guarantee the McNuggets weren't fresh. Î¾I got my food before I even got my change. Î¾It had all been sitting there well before I ordered. Î¾Besides the food, service was terrible. Î¾There was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food. Î¾It made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour. Î¾Rather than calling out an order or order number when ready, she looked at my boss and said ""this is yours."" Î¾How rude! Î¾There was a gentelman waiting for his food since before I walked in and was still waiting after I got mine. Î¾His wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh. Î¾She got a dirty look from the same rude cashier. Î¾I miss the days of the old manager whom I have not seen in a few months. Î¾He had the staff on their game."
"When you need a fast bite (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) so you can hit the road, this McDonald's is right off the 15 fwy on Charleston in the downtown area. It is clean, no bad people, and a fast drive thru. I gamble but not when it comes to fast and friendly McDonald's service. That is I like this one here."
"I was not impressed with my visit this time to this location. Suprisingly it was by someone who is a shift manager who was working the window. How can you take my order over the speaker and still have a conversation with another employee? It took her several tries to get my order right!! Then when I get to the window she doesn't even say hi or tell me my total just puts her hand out for payment. As I gave her my card I asked her to please give me jelly and extra syrup and butter. All she did was smile when I said thank you. Took them a good 15 minutes to get my stuff as she was a way from window by the inside counters talking to employees. When she finally gave me my order I reasked that I got the jelly and syrup and she goes to reach to get some and then says OH its in the bag. Now I ordered Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and Bacon, two sausage and egg mcmuffins, hashbrown and a coke. When I got home I got everything BUT the HASH Browns!!!! I was to get two of them one with the Big Breakfast and the extra one I ordered. UGGG it was on my receipt. the name on the receipt stated KS #15. So not right especially by someone in Management"
"I used to go to this one a lot (when fast food was a regular staple in my diet, in my 20's, when my metabolism was faster, and when exercise was not such a priority)- this is one of the older ones in town. Recently, we went through the Drive-Thru window for some fruit smoothies. There were a couple cars in front of us. Clear mike, speedy checkout, nice girls, the correct order, and great-tasting smoothies. We only go to McD's for a few things (parfait, cone, and sometimes the breakfast sandwich) and even then, it's pretty sporadic- maybe a few times a year, because of the lifestyle changes we made since maintaining our weight."
"I don't think this McD has ever been remodeled. Other than a badass painting of the McKingdom, there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus (cacti) sewn in to it and there was another case that had a bunch of old pins and buttons and I don't think there was a pin that was made later than 1982 or something. One was for ""McDonalds Pizza""This thing (the painting) was pretty badass though, that's why I took the pic. It's like 10' x 6'. I think it was dated 1979. Which makes sense considering that Mayor McCheese is there and the McKingdom is there tooI swear that place has been forgotten in time. Not only did it have the vintage artwork but the soda fountain was probably from the 80's as well because the ice machine and sodas were completely separate machines and there was a pay phone outside but it wasn't right outside the store, it was across the parking lot kind of in the bushes and had some weird phone company that I never heard of on it. Plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the ""Play Place"" was outdoors and even had a sing that said ""Please Do Not Feed The Birds"". Such a weird place. It's cool because it reminds of the way McDonald's was when I was a kid but it's scary because it's not intentionally retro, it just never changed...It's quite the experience. It's like the ""Classic"" McDonald's on Flamingo .....but a different kind of classic."
"I was kinda upset during my last visit here. Normally, I pay using my debit card but on this occasion I had cash. So here comes the disappointment... As the cashier goes to hand me my change she drops some of it! (Note: I'm in the drive thru so it is not easily retrivable.) She then looks and shrugs here shoulders and kept it pushing! I looked like WTH?!?!?!? She didn't open the drawer and give me correct change nothing she dropped my change and kept it pushing! I've never experienced this before. They have always corrected the change when THEY drop it. I mean she dropped it before I even put my had out the cat window. I'm like come on now... I didn't drop it! Its not MY fault. Urgh! Anyways this experience was overall annoying and off putting!"
"I think that the preparation was a tad lacking. I used to work at a Mc D's when I was in high school. It was the perfect job for a kid. Î¾Anyway, my filet was lopsided. It was half way off the bun and my cheese was melted three quarters off the fish. The tartar was every where and my fries were all mushy. I can't expect much from a Mc D's but goodness. There are some interesting folks who come in and out of here. THe awesome thing was that wall of the original Ronald Mc Donald and his lil side kicks. That was cool."
Employees here really take pride in their restaurant. Î¾They made sure the dining area was clean and their napkins and ketchup station was stocked up and clean. Î¾Well organized restaurant. Î¾Great job!
"Breakfast with a view!There really is only one reason for you to go to a McD's on the strip... you're hungry and/or drunk.As far as McD's go, this is a pretty nice one! Clean and modern with a lot of staff working all the time.This place has one major perk though, you get to watch people misbehaving while they're drunk or on drugs! Seriously, I had a blast!! It started with me arriving while the cops were handcuffing a junkie on the parking lot. The guy was talking to himself and shouting insanely funny random words at people (purple melons anyone?) And that wasn't all! There was a sweet old lady inside (who was definitely schizophrenic) having a lovely conversation with her other selves. And the guy cleaning the mensroom was asleep inside a cubicle with the door open! Loved it!"
"Approximately, only one register open with 20 drunk people in line. The ""pick up here"" takes about 15 mins to get your food. The slowest McDonalds I been to. The dinning area isn't as clean. One thing, the restaurant is very trendy and has free wifi. It's right next order to circus circus.. But, your stuck with a bunch of drunk people being very loud and annoying. Be prepare for it! Restroom was very dirty!!"
"BEWARE!!!!! This Mcdonalds tows vehicles like nobody's business. Major scam going on at this location!!!' My friends ALMOST got their car towed and THEY WERE EATING THERE!!!! They ran out as the ass hole tow guy was lifting it. Would not put it down even after we my friends said they were customers here. They haven't eve finished their lunch yet!!!! The ass tow guy wanted $200 CASH or he was towing it!!! Well, they paid but after getting home they contacted corporate and got their money back!!! Î¾MCDONALDS...YOU NEED TO RETHINK WHO YOU HIRE AS YOUR TOW COMPANY. Franchise owner of this Mcdonalds.... you suck for letting this happen and pretending you don't know what's going on. You hired this tow company!!!!!! THEY ARE SCAMMING INNOCENT CUSTOMERS BIG TIME. ****Anyone having their vehicle towed wrongly, needs to contact mcdonalds corporate and get their money back! ****"
"Beware of this Mcdonalds. You are constantly under surveillance in the parking lot. I parked my car, had breakfast, and then had to go drop something off to a friend. Within 30 min when I got back, they had my car towed. WTF? It's like they are preying on people's cars. It makes you never want to go to this McDonald's again."
"Like all other McDonald's, the service quality is going down the tubes. Î¾My son was getting a drink at the drink station when an older guy in his 60's was moping the floor and told me son to ""move it"" in a very mean and rude voice.I went to use the restroom and there was two toilets. Î¾One had a sign on the door that read ""Out of service."" Î¾The other stall's door would not make a close connection. Î¾I really had to go, but I did not care to have someone walk in on me when I am on the pot. Î¾I tried slamming the door shut, but it would not make a connection. Î¾I told management about it, but they seemed to busy to care of do anything about it."
They are making this the worst Vegas experience towing Î¾$300 dollars for 15 minutes Why instead they don't have someone giving information They're making money attacking travelers
The only reason I came back is because they gave me free food after the fiasco from last night.
"fast, Î¾a little toooo fast"
"My wife and I went to this location after being at Circus Circus at approximately 10pm a Friday night. Î¾It was busy, but not chaotic.You place your order at one end of the counter and pick up at the end of the counter.I ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese combo and asked to make it large. Î¾My wife simply ordered a small drink and a McFlurry. Î¾We specifically told the girl we were eating in. Î¾When our number was called, our food was in a to go bag. Î¾I was also only given one small cup. Î¾When I asked where my large drink cup was, I was informed that the combo which I paid extra for did not include a drink????The lady was wearing a white shirt and spoke very poor English. Î¾When I showed her my receipt where it said I had paid for a large Combo, she told me I was mistaken. Î¾I then proceeded to go back to the cashier who had rung up my order and ask her what had happened. Î¾She informed me that I should have got a Large cup as well as small cup but the lady in the white was her Manager. Î¾I then asked to speak to another manager. Î¾The cashier then waited until the female manager went in the back and a male manager came up, apologized, and gave me my Large cup. Î¾????? Î¾He agreed that I was correct and that the cashier had rung up our order correctly but could not give me a reason as to why the female manager would not give me a Large cup."
"I'm usually very skeptical of fast food joints altogether, ESPECIALLY McDonald's. But I was surprised at the huge size and grand design of the building. Lines were orderly, service was quick, and our food was unusually fresh and neat. And as always, cheap as can be.By far the best McDonald's I've been to. There are even TV screens up above that show aquarium video to keep us entertained."
"If you stay at the Riviera Hotel across the street, you are probably going to stop into this McDonald's for it's Wifi.This McDonald's will have long lines late at night for hungry club goers. Sometimes the crazy drunk guests make for some great entertainment as you wait for your order. There will be a sparse amount of homeless, but they don't seem to bother anyone."
"We went to McDonalds on our way to Circus Circus. I remember eating at a horrible buffet at Circus Circus and didn't want to go there for breakfast.I would avoid this place on the weekends. It was too chaotic we went on a Saturday morning around 11am. We went a second time on a weekday and the lines were more manageable. The workers call your numbers when your order is ready. However, there needs to be a better system. Our number wasn't called and our order was sitting on the counter for 10 minutes.Oh well. Cheap breakfast grub."
"Beware! They rip out foreigners.I visited there last monday night and had the worst Vegas experience ever. The story is simple. I parked my car in their lot and had some Subway sandwiches at the next door. And got back to the McDonald's getting some deserts. Just after I left the door. My wife and I got shocked. They towed my car. It happened just in 15 minutes. There's a sign saying, ""30 minutes parking for McDonald's customers"" Î¾I didn't do anything wrong.At the impound yard, I met other victims from Germany. They're making money attacking travelers from outside US."
"Sometimes, you HAVE to have your McDonald's. Î¾Even when you're in the middle of a culinary Mecca.Apparently I'm a sucker for grand openings and press releases blown way out of proportion, because after reading about this new McD's location I made a point to come here during my vacation.Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been to, considering there was an employee constantly cleaning and offering to clear customers' trays. Î¾Educational excerpts from the Discovery, Science, and Travel Channels on various flat screen TVs were a nice touch.We sat in the middle of the restaurant, on bar stools (surprise, surprise...see my Blueberry Hill review) attached to a huge counter...with fresh flowers! Î¾We were surrounded by the typical plastic booths but I did notice that seating areas near the restrooms offered both club chairs (not sure if they were leather or pleather) and a more private booth section.Not much to say about the food since a McNugget here is a McNugget anywhere. Î¾But at least I got my quarterly McD's craving out of the way..."
"I gotta give a shout out to this McDo!!! Staying at the Encore in Vegas... a bunch of girls lounging around in our PJs, lagging on getting ready to hit up the clubs, we started getting hungry, but were pressed on time. With a list of everyone's orders in hand, two of my girlfriends and I took a cab in our PJs to the nearest McDonald's and ordered $80 worth of food!!! I thought it was hilarious that we bought 90 pieces of chicken mcnuggets, lol! The food came out fast and the only thing missing that we realized only after already being back in our hotel was a Vitamin Water... at least no one was missing a meal. So for that, thanks McDo!"
"A nice central McDonald's with ample fountain drink dispensers for the visitors. Be aware of your surroundings here, it attracts a few transient people. The WiFi provided by AT&T sometimes works, just like their cellular reception, so no surprise there. I'm a frequent visitor here to grab drinks & work before visiting hotels. There are quite a few power plugs for laptops inside of the building."
"I am not a fan of fast food. But sometimes a girls gotta eat late! I came here after my LONG flight from Honolulu and I was pretty darn hungry. They were out of Southwest salads, but the bacon chicken wasn't bad. The salad was still fresh and the chicken was warm. I would go back if I ever had a late night McCraving!"
"I should have known better. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been to McDonald's in the past ten years. However, my choices were extremely limited so I thought I'd give it another shot. This visit was a reminder why I don't come here. It totally sucked!1. The staff was unpleasant.2. The fries were room temperature.3. The burger tasted vile.4. I have no complaints about the diet Coke.Next time I'll just go hungry."
"Worst McDonald's I've ever been too! We ordered Mocha Frape, a vanilla latte and 6 cookies and we waited for 15 mins and 3 wrong drinks after. But they gave us an extra drink because of it.."
Was told at 5am that burgers arent made until 4pm by some chubby ogre latina.Stay in school kids.
"So I love McDonald's breakfast and we were on our way to the convention center for the Heli-Expo and I ordered my usual of one bacon egg and cheese biscuit, and one bacon egg and cheese McGriddle and they were great as usual. Î¾The service was also quick and good. I don't understand the people that complain about the service or food from McDonald's what do you really expect. Î¾Go somewhere else if you want better service, or literally go anywhere else but don't complain you know what you are getting yourself into. Î¾After we sat down and got our food we noticed that one of the huge front windows was completely shattered. Î¾It actually looked really neat and then we asked what happened they said that someone shot it the night before. Î¾ The other nice thing about this McDonald's is it has free Wi-Fi for all of its customers."
"Please people if you are looking for a ""fast food"" to eat do not go to this place. 15 minute for a simple double cheese burger. Employees work slower then my grandma."
"I'LL HAVE ONE BREAKFAST MCMUFFIN, HOLD THE GUNFIREIf you're in Vegas for an event at the Convention Center, you'll probably be up early enough for breakfast. If you're not there on work, you might just want to sleep through this part of the day. McDonald's breakfast is not sold nearly long enough. I never make it there on time! How hard would it be to serve eggs all day?!! Î¾In any case, this McD's is convenient to the convention center.We stopped here more than once on our last Vegas trip a couple months back. On one of the visits while dining in, we noticed a bullet hole in the window from the night before. Someone probably mad about breakfast not being served all day is my guess.Service was good. Food was average. The coolest thing about this location was the deco. It was so modern inside. Clean and cool. I like that."
"The WORST service I've encountered in a McDonalds so far in the continental USA. No, not because I dislike the food but because the employees here are IRRESPONSIBLE, FORGETFUL, and UNAPOLOGETIC. I overheard from one of my superiors that the staff at this particular McDonalds ALWAYS screws up orders EVERY time they come here. They will charge you for the wrong item, leave out several items, give Iced Tea instead of Iced coffee. When I was there, I was the first one to order and I ordered the Skillet Burrito and some OJ. My OJ came out after 3 minutes but my food never came out. ALL OF MY co-workers ordered their food and their food came out and they were already seated and having their breakfast while I'm still standing at the counter waiting for my burrito for a good 10 minutes. I finally lost my patience and ask the girl who rang me up where my Skillet Burrito was. She simply says ""Oh, it's run out, ""we NO HA-VEH"". I tell her ""So are you going to just stand there and do NOTHING?!?!?!?!?"" That's when she asks me ""What do you want???"" You want burrito!?? We only HA-VEH Sausage and Egg Burrito it's ok? I say ""NO, it's NOT OK because Skillet burrito is MUCH more expensive than a Sausage and Egg Burrito!! Just give me two McGriddles...NO!!!!"" And so she did.PURE RETARDED OPERATIONS at this particular McDonalds. Will NEVER return to this McDonalds or even McDonalds in particular. Only reason we ate here was because we needed to grab a super quick breakfast before heading to the convention center."
"I'm a Mclover, and I had no problemwith the workers. But I have a problem waiting more than 30 minutes for my cheeseburger. They weren't even busy! This was my first and last time at this location."
"Cold terrible cardboard on a bun, trashy service, homeless people drinking 24oz cans of Natural Ice inside the place!"
"This McDonald's is located just a couple of blocks from the hotel I stayed at in Las Vegas - an Embassy Suites Hilton property - therefore it is within walking distance (There does not appear to be many businesses within walking distance of this hotel).Had a late lunch here around 2:00 pm. Î¾Ordered the #3 value meal: Quarter Pounder w/ cheese, medium fries and lemonade.Meal came up promptly, was hot, not greasy, fries were crisp - all was good!Interesting note: in order to use the restrooms - you have to let them know at the counter - and then they buzz you in - no physical key. Makes me wonder about the status of the surrounding neighborhood!There is also a large red DVD rental machine in the dining area of this Mickey D's."
"I agree with Douglas--this is one of the best McDonald's in Las Vegas. Î¾I stopped here for a quick ice cream last night and I was immediately impressed with the newness and nice design of the place.The staff took my order quickly, and I was on my way to a table very quickly. Î¾The tables were clean and the restaurant was clean. Î¾I was really impressed!They have free wifi which is a nice bonus. Î¾If I need at break some day and I'm in the area, I'll definitely stop again."
Truly disgusting place.
This place sucked! I ordered a sausage mcmuffin and the cashier was slow in making it. She even forgot the harshbrowns that were included in the meal. Also the ketchup dispenser sprayed everywhere and went on my shirt. The most dumbest stupidest mcdonalds i've been to. Avoid this place if u want to eat at a mcdonalds restaurant. There are better mcdonalds places than this one.
"Went here to get some cookies for a friend. The drive thru person Lamoni, sucked and couldn't tell the difference from coffee to her asshole, also a car broke down in the drive thru."
"The service here was terrible. They got my breakfast order wrong three times, each time with the same exact mistake. The morning Î¾cashier there, dalia, didn't even attempt to move a muscle to get me the right order. Food is just like any other mcdonalds, service was the worst. There's 50 others you can go to within a mile anyway"
"One of best McDonalds in Vegas, always very clean,, great service ,, close to the Las Vegas Strip..."
"I try to steer clear of fast food when I can, but sometimes they just sound so delicious or they are the most convenient to have. For instance, the daughter was hungry and I was in a rush to get ready for an event and this McDonald's was across from SLS, which at the day of our visit to McDonald's was not open yet and therefore did not have functional restaurants yet. We went through the drive thru and it was easy and manageable.This is a typical McDonald's with nothing to make them more memorable than other locations (in a good or bad way). But if you are staying in the vicinity and in need of fast food, do try them. Their drive thru is also open 24 hours so they are very convenient if you need calories late at night (which happens a lot in Las Vegas, go figure!). Overall, not a bad McDonald's."
"Fast food typically just is what it is, but this particular McDonald's was awful.The service was terrible, Î¾the cashier had an attitude not only with me but pretty much every customer that came through her line in the 15 minutes I waited to get my food (basic big mac & fries, nothing special). She forgot to give me my drink and when I asked her for it she tried to give me the size below what I ordered. When I asked for the right size she practically insisted I take the smaller one. Then when my order was up and I asked for ketchup, she rolled her eyes and acted like I was making her go so far out of her way to reach under the counter. Then, when I went to the fountain to get my drink, there were small bugs flying all around it.Best part was when I got back and ate my food and realized that my fries were cooked in the same fryer the do the fish in. Pretty sure those are supposed to be separate. Threw those out, so ended up not needing the ketchup anyways. Definitely do yourself a favor and go to a different location."
This is the absolute worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my entire life! This place was filthy. Nearly every empty table was littered and in our 30 minutes there no one came to clean the dining area. Owner should be ashamed and management fired!
Worst service and food I have ever experienced at McDonald's l have ever been to.Completely wrong order. Ignored at counter when trying to get corrected and even then wrong order and yet again ignored. You would think they would be sensitive on the third time retuning to get a complete order. But no. And then ignored the fourth time when asking to get access to the bathroom.
"Worst service I have ever experienced. I know what can I expect coming from a fast food but still. First at drive thru I asked for sauce and he gave them to me with no hesitation. He drops a sauce and I ask for another one, and he replies with a smart attitude ""I'm suppose to charge you for these but I'm not and you still want more?"" ... If I was going to be charge I would have liked for him to tell me from the beginning. I have no problem paying for sauce I'm going to use. Besides bad people skills I got my order wrong.... Not once, not twice... But 4 times. And on the 4th time It was still wrong, but I was beyond over it!"
"I was craving a chocolate milkshake, a few days ago so this was the nearest mcdonalds that was in my travel route. I decided to go thru drive thru and full fill my cravings. I also got nuggets and fries.....now here is the worst. My fries were OLD not even recooked old they were old as in they sat there for more than an hour they tasted like yesterdays fries . Chewy, bland, rough , cold and disgusting. My nuggets were old and my milkshake gave me, the worst stomach ache. May I add the cashier or mgr shirt was filthy at the bottom . Like she was washing dishes and cleaning the grill or broiler, whatever it is they have. Then she was handling the food ......yuck! Clean your clothes ! I felt like it was run by homeless people and the manager in charge of this restaraunt is not following mcdonalds standards ..Ive had better."
"extremely terrible service. They couldn't get my order right the first time, like seriously how hard is it to get a couple sandwiches right!!"
"Worst McDonald's ever...tweekers ""spare changing"" freely, some lady threatened to beat another lady's ass, following her around yelling, dirty drink area, etc. The building looks good, as the only good point. I'll never return to this location if I can avoid it!"
"Grabbed quick breakfast ...service was slow and the dining room was filled with the joyful abundance of homeless and just crazy people of Las Vegas.As said before coffee was warm at best, my egg McMuffin without Sausage was cold and greasy!"
"So I'm not usually one to fuss, pretty laid back so if something bothered me then well....bravo. This mcdonalds isn't in the greatest area, I can't fault the employees for that. I can expect that they get some shady characters and they sometimes you have to handle them a little bit more aggressively. Like tonight, customer causing a minor disturbance and was rude, and the girl which appeared to be a manager of some sort was behind the counter and got upset (naturally of course) she went and handled the customer. Waited for him to come out of the bathroom just waiting there while customers including myself were in line. Ok I get it, go handle the customer, go on with your bad self and handle the shituation. Yes I said shit-u-ation. I get it, go handle the stupid idiot. But when there's a line of customers waiting for service you would think you would get someone to cover you instead us waiting 5 minutes or ATLEAST a simple apology saying ""I'm sorry I'll be right with you"" instead she was cursing and mumbling under her breath. OH and she proceeded to follow him outside, let it go! He left! So another employee finally started taking orders only after telling me she was already clocked out! Unprofessional. Like come on handle the idiot but don't act like one. Rant over. Oh....and my fries are good."
"This is the ONLY fast food restaurant (this specific location) in the history of fast food restaurants, that has delivered a grilled chicken sandwich that actually looks like the item on the menu, instead of a smashed piece of baby food. Amazing. It's McDonald's so... eh, it's okay, not my favorite. But yeah, 3 stars for delivering a product that looks like the advertisement."
Mixed up order: forgot fries. Î¾Crispy chicken instead of grilled. Î¾Put mayo in sandwich when asked for it on the side.Cash only for drive through but accepted credit when dining in...
"I left the Hilton late last night and I was really thirsty. Î¾This was an easy in/out option for me from Sahara. Î¾I did the drive through and was on my way with a Diet Coke in about 2 minutes.This is one of the remaining early style McDonald's outlets and there's a classic Chevrolet parallel to the drive through where you can take photos.Looking through the windows, I could see the interior is also the classic design. Î¾I'll have to go back and sit inside. Î¾Do I see a Shamrock shake in my near future?"
"Out of the thousands of restaurants in Vegas, I had to pick a McDonalds...Well, its a cheap eat. Its right across the Sahara Hotel and its design is like one of those classic type McDonalds back in the 50s, just like Scott D. said below. There is nothing special about it. I had gone through the drive-thru at 11:30pm. I was a little scared since there was people playing music loud and just hanging around suspiciously. I had to wait 5-7 minutes for the lady to get back to me on the speaker. It wasn't even crowded inside.Anyways, I ordered 2 McDoubles ($1 each), 2 Hot N' Spicy ($1 each), 2 Bottle Water ($1 each), and 2 Apple Pies (2 for $1), and a Large Iced Tea ($1 each no matter of the size or type of drink). My total was $9.50.Nothing special about this place besides the classic car who probably has been waiting for service since forever. Oh well, what can you do in the city of sin?!Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!"
"1st to Review-How can this be? A CLASSIC McDonald's @offthestrip at Paradise Rd/Sahara Ave behind the Sahara Casino!Coolest thing about this location is their collection of McDonald's Happy Meal Toys and the 50's style look & feel.They have a 50's Chevy out front for taking photos.Unfortunately the same boring,tasteless food."
Food is good as always. Cool design outside and single golden arches make this a cool spot to hit up after the club or gambling on the strip.
"Wow, this place was so good after the night was over! There is always so much walking on the strip and being in club attire and dress boots I was so happy to sit on their un-cushioned seats and eat my big mac and fries.Service was quick and food was typical Mcdonald's.Air conditioned and yummy. Most satisfying Mc D's I've had!"
"I would never usually review a McDonalds, but here's why this place rules:1) $5 for a 20 pack of Chicken McNuggets at 3am. When everything else in the food court was closed, we had this trusty option which ended up being our ""go to"". I couldn't imagine how extra hungover I would've been each morning without this grease.2) An alternative to overpriced breakfast at the buffet at the hotel.3) A quick way of grabbing something for less than $5 when not needing a full meal during the day.5 stars for that!"
"I cannot give a 4 or 5 star rating for any junk food place such as McDonald's. Their food is not fresh, but frozen so really the only rating, aside from food, is the cleanliness, staff etc.This place is packed and understaffed. It was about midnight and I could see 2 people working behind the counter making the food. The manager was doing her best to keep the food coming out of the kitchen, but clearly was short handed. Napkins were empty, and floors were sticky.The food even tasted worse by McDonald's standards. Just not a good experience.I come to McDonald's for emergencies only."
"I was thirsty and decided to get a drink. Î¾McDonald's is the best place to get something cheap, especially when you're on the strip."
"I needed a quick breakfast before catching my flight back to new york. This McDonalds was located inside my hotel in the food court section. I ordered my orange juice, sausage biscuit, some pancakes and on my way I went. Î¾It was a bit of a wait but my order was complete and the food was ok."
No Hot Mustard :(
"Was a busy day, I didn't have time for a healthy lunch. I saw a Mcdonalds so I decided what the heck, im in a hurry and I m kind of hungry. My order took forever, I didn't go thru the drive thru as I don't trust them, my fries were medium warm as was my burger, I didn't have time to wait for another order so I left, I was dissatisfied with my order but it was a Mcdonalds after all."
"Just an unpleasant experience. I live here in Las Vegas and will often take family to the Strip when they come to town. We were looking for a late night bite to eat and decided on McDonald's since it was right in the hotel. The servers were incredibly rude. My aunt had only asked if they were serving smoothies and the girl behind the register rolled her eyes and responded with an attitude. After receiving our food, I had asked another employee where I could find straws. She intentionally ignored me upon my first attempt to get her attention. When she finally turned around after talking to her friend, she acted as if I was burdening her.Maybe I'm expecting too much from a fast food place on the Strip, but I feel that if you are working in customer service, you should be providing customer service, not acting as if you are still in high school and hanging onto that angsty teenager we all have inside us."
The oatmeal was good. The fruit was crisp and the raisins plump. The sweet tea was fresh.
I work in the area and have eaten here several times. I can attest to the fact that this is one of the worst McDonalds to eat at.You can at least be sure of consistent service. Consistently lousy. Consistently noisy and consistently dirty.Only eat here as a last resort
"This is by far the worst service I have ever had in any fast food restaurant.Now I understand that working fast food isn't easy, but having a burger tossed at me was the end of the line. Enough said, so upset that I tossed right back at the rude ass lady behind the counter. If you can wait a couple more feet, there are way more options than this pile of dump. The only thing worse than having to walk through the Excalibur, is walking by that stink hole."
"On Christ almighty here it goes. If I am going to eat overpriced McDonalds in a casino I better get what the hell I want to eat. This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight Î¾cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've. Î¾If you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service."
This is a lousy McDonalds. So slow. So surly. Once you finally get the food it doesn't even seem to matter anymore.
"Horrible service!! Not friendly at all. I asked for a couple of sauces, they told me I would have to pay 52 cents! What happened to customer service? Worst mcdonalds I have been too. Cheesy move on their part. Giving them one star is being generous"
"This place is a joke! It's disgusting enough of a fact that the only thing to eat at Excalibur between the hours of 0200 and 0600 is McDonald's, Starbucks, and Krispy Kreme. But then, to be forced to go to McDonald's and find this pitiful excuse of an establishment instead.... for shame. The first night they ran out of Butterfinger topping for a McFlurry. The second night, they claimed their ice cream machine was ""locked."" Not broken.... but locked. WTF is that?!?! If you are the only late night eatery available, you better have all your menu items available because I have a bit of a sweet tooth. This place is a joke... do yourself a favor and walk across the footbridge to New York New York and eat at America, their late night cafe."
"The McDonald's chronicles.Hooray for free refills.I just want a bite to eat, make my daughter happy. not spend a lot of money, and drink as much soda as I can quenching my thirst is the dry air. Î¾The McDonald's doesn't charge that much of a premium. Î¾The place is clean and is a good, affordable rest before putting the feet down back on the strip's concrete."
"This McDonald's is located inside the Excalibur hotel and was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Mickey D's. We wanted a quick breakfast at around 9:30 a.m., so my friend decided to grab some for us to bring back to the room before heading out for the day. He ended up waiting over 30 minutes in line to get 2 egg Mcmuffins and coffee, and I had to wander out of the room to see what the hold up was. There was also no dollar menu available when we were there, so we ended up paying the $3 for a greasy sandwich. By the time we got the food back to the room it was cold, but at least the coffee stayed warm."
This McD's wasn't too bad. Not too busy when we went to grab some late breakfast. You can't beat the dollar menu either. $1 salad from there is nutritionally equivalent to eating something from Quiznos (which my friend had in the food court and hated) at a fraction of the price.
"Yes, this is a McDonald's...Yes, McDonald's hasn't been all that ever since they got rid of their Angus Deluxe and Premium Chicken sandwiches... I've tried the Quarter Pounder...no mayo, no cheese... and it's just not the same. Although, the food here is better than at any other McDonald's location that I've tried.But it's not the food that gives this location four stars. During the summer months, it turns into a sobering up/hook up spot for drunk, half naked, female, Ditch Fridays patrons... It's the best eye candy you'll find at a Micky D's."
"This is probably the worst McDonald's ever.. They don't know what they're doing at all! Ice cream machine is always ""broken"", customers always waiting, food always takes forever even with 3+ people in the kitchen... I don't understand why they're still open."
Nasty ass restaurant. Burnt ass chicken nuggets and the dumbasses working didn't want to give me new ones.
Just left here. Screwed up my order 3 times. When I was the only customer there and then giving me attitude because I kept returning with wrong items. You work at McDonald's. You punch a button and you read the screen . Yet you still manage to screw up a b-fast sand which lol.. 3 times. The art of fast food baffles me. Totally makes me lose hope in humanity. We actually left threw the McDonald out and Î¾went to Burger King and they screwed up there too but just once... Still hungry.
Couldn't get a chocolate-dipped cone because they shut off the ice cream machine at midnight. WTF?!
This is for the McDs inside the Palms Food Lobby. 50 Chicken Nuggets for 10 dollars. That's all you need to know. Six Stars.
I had only eaten at 1 McD previously in my life but Zak R got me to try the hash browns here and I have to admit they are delicious. Cinnamon buns were no Cinnabuns but surprisingly fluffy and yummy.
bleh-bad mcdonalds food.slow service.and never get orders right. ever.
"I'm definitely a fan of this McDonald's tucked on the side of a Terrible's gas station and convenience store. Î¾Before it's gone, I had to get one of their seasonal egg nog shakes.I drove here from Wally World and parked directly in front of the door. Î¾There were a few people at the drive through and a few inside the McDonald's itself.The counter person came quickly and took my order. Î¾I paid and stood aside while she made the shake. Î¾It was quickly given to me and it was good. Î¾One of my few (that's a joke) bad holiday habits.I was soon on my way happily sipping this sweet goodness and already plotting to stop for just one more before they're gone."
"Idiot at the counter forced me to buy a quarter pounder with cheese because he didn't understand what ""buy one get one ANY large sandwich"" meant. - and the picture happened to show a pic of a quarter pounder. Yet also says valid for product of equal or lesser value...so twice exhibiting that you can buy any large sandwich and get one free. See picture attached to review.1 star"
"Stopped in in the early morning hours knowing full well I would need some serious calories for the hours ahead. Î¾I walked throughout he Terrible Herbst (TH) which this location is connected to. Î¾No line inside, I was told someone would be with me shortly. I waited, and waited some more. Î¾I made eye contact with the ""white shirt,"" Î¾I believe this was the HMFIC because they were dressed differently then everyone else. Î¾The HMFIC failed to smile back. Î¾I went into HM (Hater Mode) and walked out. Î¾I made my purchases at TH and punched out. Î¾I reevaluated my time line for the morning and decided....I needed calories. Î¾I rolled into the drive-thru and made my purchase quickly and efficiently. Î¾The chow was exactly as McD's does....A-OK."
"I'm drunk, I come here and order a hot and spicy ( sub The mannaise Î¾with Mac sauce) and 2 breakfast burritos. Tell me why I didn't get any hot and spicy??? What the fudge???"
"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. I never write bad reviews but I have to let this one out. I keep coming back because it's the closest to me and I've been hoping that eventually they will get my order right, but I've gotten to the point where I would drive 10 miles for a better service. I had to drive back three times for one order one night, the drive thru takes forever, the staff never takes the right order and the food is always hit or miss. It's pretty ridiculous. I don't expect 5 star service from McDonald's but damn this place has driven me CRAZY!!! Good luck all."
Quarter pounder was really dry and bun was like a cardboard. Had to wait for workers to stop playing around in the back so someone could refill our sweet tea because they we out at the refill station. Only gave it one star because the place was clean.
This place is infamous for having a rude cashier and not having things in stock. Complaints to management here go on deaf ears. I go out of my way to go to the one on Durango cause of so many bad experiences here- this location really gives the brand a bad name!
"I love McDonald's... Duh but I'm eating my mcchicken and the bun is hard which usually happens after 9pm anyways! Oh well I also ordered Big Mac and 20 pc. Chicken nugget... When we got to the window I asked for various sauces including an ""Asian sauce"" but the guy at the window took total offense and copped an attitude with me. He asked if I meant sweet chili sauce?? I felt like I may have upset him for some reason (but we are all ppl and I wouldn't have been insulted if he asked me for white sauce!! LoL) so I said sorry and that I meant the Kung pao sauce. But he said that didn't exist and was a dick! I'm glad I didn't ask for gay sauce. Ha! Dude come on. Ppl r ppl. It is what it is!!"
"No milk for the coffee. Only cream. No wonder everyone is fat. Get my coffee, and it's half full. Awesome. All in all, all Micky D's in Vegas suck.On a side note, the new oatmeal is pretty damn good."
HOW SAD! If you yelpers don't give Mcdonalds 5 stars you are on crack this place is Gods gift to the world! Long live the Big Mac!
"About as average as your local McDonald's can be. Î¾This one is right up middle alley, not great but not spectacular either. Î¾I just find it surprising the skinny-richie-constant work-outie people up here in Summerlin keep this place busy! Î¾I mean literally not even a block away is Lifetime Fitness! Î¾That place is hardcore.Food = OK. Î¾Service = OK. Î¾Fast and efficient as a colonoscopy. Î¾Really nothing of greatness at this McDonald's. Î¾Really run of the mill. Î¾We often visit this location if we are staying in the nearby Red Rock Casino. Î¾Although I would suppose this location stays steadily busy is in part because of the tourists that stay at the Red Rock as well and want cheap eats while on vacation. Î¾Gotta make up for all those lost wages!Newest thing at McDonald's is their health-conscious Egg White 'Delight' McMuffin. Î¾Definitely a healthier take on their breakfast menu. Î¾And yes, I fell for that damn $1 coupon conveniently stuck to my McDonald's bag and tried one. Î¾Myself being a bit of a health nut can't complain. Î¾This egg white creation is pretty tasty. Î¾Grilled egg whites, Canadian bacon (eh?), and white cheddar all on a toasted English muffin? Î¾All for only 250 calories? Î¾Yeah for a dollar I really liked it. Î¾But at the regular price of almost $3? Î¾I would have probably passed. Î¾With coupon for $1 and a $1 coffee it made for a nice meal on the small scale of economy. Î¾I almost, ALMOST, added a $1 hash brown. Î¾Luckily I passed and decided to save my money & calories for later.Other than that, I think majority of people around the world know what McDonald's offers on their menu. Î¾If you don't, dang, you must be living under a rock? Î¾Or possibly a place where there is no McDonald's within your vicinity (like under a rock)."
"I went to this location a couple of weeks ago. This is how my visit went:I pulled in the drive thru a few minutes before 10:30am just in time for breakfast. I was the only person in the drive thru so I pulled right up to the menuI waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anythingFinally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of McdonaldsI figured this was because the order speaker was broken or somethingBut no, the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtimeI was thinking in my head .... whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?Keep in mind, my car is right there, I'm obviously waiting to order.Then the employee turned around and walked back into McDonaldsThen someone started taking my order over the speakerI ordered my breakfast items. which they informed me they were no longer serving. I was thinking in my mind ""do you not think I just saw you walk out and turn the menu, I mean my car was like 2 feet away from you""Anyway, I was craving breakfast, so I let them know I wanted to cancel my orderI was told the breakfast hours were overThen ... magically ... like a Christmas Miracle, they had breakfast for me.Truth is I was willing to leave McDonalds with out my breakfast food. I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service. That conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had. Implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly It shouldn't have been. So then, i went back a few days later (because I'm the type that gives second chances) and they missed a few items that I had ordered. Meaning I ordered them, saw it on the drive thru order menu screen, paid for it and it wasn't in my bag when they gave me my order.Yea, this is a long review, I would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far. Props to you if you have. But the whole reason behind it is that I am just super tired of getting terrible customer service and paying for food that I don't get. The reason this review is only 1 star is because I have given this place multiple visits and keep coming up with the same problem. Bad customer service."
"They advertise drive thru open 24 hours, but apparently close. I'm not sure the exact time but both times I went there was around 3am. There were no signs saying they were closed, so I sat there for a few minutes in the drive thru. Then I said hello? Twice then someone responded saying we will reopen at 4am. I was really ticked off because I wasted my time and gas. I will no longer go there."
I've been to this drive through 3 times. I order simple things like a Big Mac meal or a couple burgers and fries. Yet some how they have never gotten my order correct. Today I ordered two hamburgers and fries. My hamburgers were damp and had pickled jalape’±os instead of regular pickles. Not sure if this was a bad prank by the young staff or just a shitty burger that was made by someone who doesn't know the difference.Also their drive through is always packed and people line up into the adjacent albertsons parking lot and road. Come on fatties.... At that point park and walk in.
"Seriously, this probably was the least friendly McDonald's ever. Î¾Other than asking for our order, which was 3 coffees, they didn't say anything to us when we went to the drive-thru window or when we picked up the coffees. Î¾Not one word. Î¾We said thank you at each window.Will not go back to this McDonald's for anything."
"Be careful! Î¾I ordered an iced drink @ the drive thru. Î¾The guy @ the second window never said hi or thanks. Î¾I thought my drink was just wet on the outside. Î¾ Within minutes my Î¾plastic cup was sticky. Î¾By the time I got home my hands were sticky as well as my steering wheel, shifter, window controls. Î¾It was a lot of work getting myself & the car cleaned. Î¾I called the local office. Î¾All she said was that she was sorry & she would tell them to wipe off the glasses. Î¾She did not offer to have a manager call me &/or send me a gift card.I emailed corporate. Î¾All I have received is a form email Î¾back. Î¾It's been 5 days. Î¾I think I will stick w/iced-tea lemonades @ Coffee Beans & Tea Leaves. Î¾Bye MacDonald's!"
This is the 2nd closest McDs to my house. The closest one is so inconsistent that I come to this one more often. The drive thru can be long Î¾and they often run out of cinnamon melts but the food is at least the way I ordered it and hot when I get it. The inside is clean and a mad house during breakfast time. All in all a decent location.
"Came to this McDonald's Friday, 7/5/13, forgot to check in though, lol!! Anyways, McDonalds is suppose to be a family joint right?!, especially when they have the playland, well how is it that this place, knowing people come with kids off all ages, NOT have a changing table in the restroom???? Unbelievable!! I will say though at least this place is clean and nice but what I dont like is that they dont have a ketchup dispenser they just have ketchup packets, I personally don't like that all."
"If only this had a zero stars option. This was by far the most disgusting McDonalds I have ever been to. Do not go here. Not a single table was clean. There was trash all over the floor. Not a single customer service person smiled. There were no lids, there was no ketchup, there were no straws, there were no napkins. I asked the manager to please replenish the napkins and lids and things like that and I please clear off an area for us and she ignored me. They messed up multiple peoples orders. Just dude was horrible. It is the first time I have ever had a Big Mac and not liked it. The French fries were stale. The hamburgers were thin and hard. There were dead flies on the floor and flies flying around the restaurant. This place needs to be shut down."
"Micky D's should all be the same, but this one in the 10 plus year I've been going there has about the most stand offish unfriendly people ever. It starts from the top so I guess the owners just don't care if there employees are unfriendly."
"I would have given this 5 stars if not for the fact that the chucklefuck drive thru staff randomly leaves work at 10 when it closes at 11 and when they are working do some fucked up things.Example: I had lost my job, my wife, and my car, and a friend of mine picked me up on the side of the road, but not before I was forced to suck a dick for the $2 that would give me the moolah to afford a single pleasure in this meaningless world: a medium fry from THE KING of fast food, Ronald ""Firecrotch"" McDonald. We drove to this establishment, as it was nearest to the drug den that I had just left. Purple haze ringing in my nostrils and Nickelback blaring from the Hummer H2 behind me, I ordered my delicacy. Upon arriving at the window, I was shocked to find that the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to people who were born sideways with three umbilical cords wrapped around their extra chromosome. Good job being progressive giants, McDonalds. UNFORTUNATELY, this coke bottle glasses-wearing invalid decided to give me, a man with nary a possession to his name, a medium fry trapped indecently in a complex puzzle box constructed from bags that had clearly formerly hosted the cursed sperm sample that grew his hairy greasy ass in a test tube in Santa Monica. I was speechless, but since I couldn't afford a drink, a fire in the hole was not possible and I had to suffice with a middle finger held aloft by my comrade in my defense against this venerable Smaug of the culinary industry. Never again. 9/11 is in my heart today and tomorrow and the next day but after that idk seriously."
"I've been through in on a number of occasions and have never had a problem.Food is typical Mcdonalds and it's always hot so nothing to complain about here. The drive through is usually fast. As for whether or not the staff is friendly, I usually go here early in the morning, so I really don't care. I'm not friendly myself in the morning LOL Î¾ Î¾ So as long as my order arrives promptly and they don't talk much and my coffee is hot Î¾I'm good with it."
"Yes...it has come to this. Î¾I only feel compelled to write this review because I work nearby, and I visit this McDonalds at least once a week. Î¾I admit, I am a Dollar Menu addict. Where else can you get reasonably full for less than $5 for lunch. Nevermind the guilt and dangerous chemicals.Anyway, the set up of the drive through makes for a real pain during peak lunchtime hours. This McDonalds is situated in a busy shopping center, right next to a Starbucks, Del Taco, Albertsons, Bank of America, and other shops. Things get rather congested and hard to maneuver. Î¾However, as McDonalds goes, it is fine. The service is usually friendly and prompt (although the new guy they have in the drive thru is a *tad* too chatty!), and they haven't messed up my order. Î¾Freshness and hotness varies, however."
"This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to by far. I cannot think of enough bad things to say about their service.The Food is standard McDonald's fair, but, they did not give us our drinks with creamer, our order was wrong, the food oatmeal came without enough spoons for the orders count, we had to go back 3 times for all sorts of condiments, and they dish em out reservedly like their lives depend on it.They do not seem to understand foreign accents and this is Las Vegas, seriously, if you are going to run a shop in a tourist town, you might as well be prepared for it."
"Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the staff at this location isn't all that friendly."
"I stop here now and then as it's the closest to where I live. Î¾Customer service used to be awful, but ti seems like they've gotten a bit better. Î¾Today I got a side salad and a shamrock shake. Î¾Everything was A-OK!"
"My least favorite fast food place but my daughter's favorite so we make the appearance every now and then. Î¾McDonalds has the best kids meals and playplaces so for my seven year old this is a great place. Î¾Love the apple slices and much smaller fry bags for the kids.The sundays are good and the recently added smoothies are great. Î¾Very disappointed in the new popcorn style chicken. It is worse than KFC's popcorn chicken was before they made larger pieces. Î¾In fact, most of my box was just fried coating with little or no chicken. Î¾ Î¾As fast food places go, I find McDonalds the most consistent in quality and taste. Î¾I love their breakfasts and the chicken nuggets are still the best. Î¾Avoid the angus burgers. Î¾They are not as good as advertized."
"If you are thinking ""WTF?"", don't worry, I am too. Yes, I am writing a review of McDonald's. As a child, I was a fiend for their french fries. If we were within 100-yards of the spot, I could smell those suckers and break into tears with FF desire. Fast-forward to today, and I can't remember the last time I ate food from McDonald's. (Ice cream cones don't count, and neither do desperate breakfasts on the road with a band.) However, two things:1. This location has a 24-hour drive thru.2. They now have smoothies! When it's midnight and you want a smoothie, what do you do? Consider ordering a Wild Berry or Mango-Pineapple from Mickey D's. They are cold, refreshing and tangy. All in all a decent smoothie. I don't think it will kill you. (It hasn't killed me yet, but I've only had a total of 3 smoothies.)"
"After yet another night of insane Vegas partying - and enjoying alcohol a-flowin' - we got the munchies. Where did we decide to go? When it's late and you want something cheap and easy (insert favorite jokes here), very little tops fast food.We drove to a random McDonald's with a KFC next door - FYI, there are a LOT of them between the Strip and Red Rock (our hotel). At the drive-thru, we placed an order for large fries and 20 Chicken McNuggets.When we went to get our food, we were told they were out of large fries - how does that happen??? - and were given hash browns as a substitute. Since it was between three and four in the morning, we didn't press the issue.Anyway, the McNuggets were piping hot, fed us, and I have no idea what happened to those hash browns. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?"
They didn't even deserve the 1 star I gave them. We went to this McDonalds and ordered some food. The food was good but I had some power tripping Mgr. Tell me and my son that we couldn't fill my Starbucks cup up with water....when I asked why she said because of cross contamination.....( now keep in mind this is a self service soda Î¾machine) so that argument doesn't really fly since everybody using the machine is cross contaminating it. Î¾This women poked my hand out of the way.....I'm like really women.....I left....and she says in a sarcastic tone....God bless you....I'm like he already has.... Get a life women!
I like this particular McDonalds. Service is generally fast and courteous and I've never had a problem the many times I've been here. I usually order the number 2 meal and it's always prepared the way it's supposed to be.
"This place really is hit or miss on the service.The food: cheap, that's why you go here. Period.The service: Like I said, on & off. Sometimes they mess up. They're busy.. Cause of that heaven sent dollar menu. Love hate relationship guys.Updates: They've got smoothies, & I love me some Mango Pineapple. Yum! :DI would rate only 3 stars, but it keeps the 4th cause it's down the street. I know, stupid reason. Well, shut it & write your own review... please. LOL."
"This McDonalds needs help...I used to travel alot and Mcdonalds was always the ""go to"" fast food restaurant for us. Always consistant food and fast convenient service.This branch is a very poorly run store. The last few times I have gone thru the drive thru the man taking the order was very rude. (the same person i think).. Could not seem to awnser any questions or be polite in any such way. And the food was sub par.Two nights ago, we went to grab a quick snack wrap.. We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. Tonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn't sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset? Some seriously bad service. I will pass the word on that this location has inconsistant food and horrible service. The management at this fast food branch should be fired as well as the employees who seem to think that yelling at customers and treating them poorly is okay to do."
"Good service but drive thru is slow! Î¾When I pick up breakfast for the office- this is usu the place- but just to warn every1, I think going in is faster- but if you have a big order, you may get the stink eye from the other customers- just pretend to read the newspaper- or cont yelping to avoid eye contact!"
"I must say that I had a smoothie here when they came out months ago and they are horrible and way too sweet. Sonic has better ones and McD's obviously doesn't use real fruit. Even at midnight, this is not the best sweet tooth option. Wait, there is a positive. Using my 2-1 coupon, I tried the new Strawberry Frozen Lemonade and yes like the commercials indicate it is tart and sweet. These would be a better option to cool you down at $1.59 for a small. The strawberry syrup at the bottom might be the same they use on sundaes, but who knows for sure. McDonald's comes out with new stuff every month, but in the beverage department, frozen lemonade is king."
"Small, but clean. Staff is rude. Remember the show ""Seinfeld"" instead of a soup nazi the woman, maybe the manger is a condiment nazi."
"McDonalds has not the best reputation but this has been the worst fast food experience of my lifetime.Besides waiting 20 minutes for a Big Mac, I witnessed a customer treatening to hit a member of staff. I am not sure what happened as I only arrived when the customer said he would ""hit him later"" and then left.Then staff members began shouting at each other about using each other's cashier machines. It was so obvious that the staff were untrained and completely unprofessional. The manager seemed to have lost control and was berating staff in front of other customers."
"Food is good but staff/service is HORRENDOUS. Every single time I go there they mess up my order, in my opinion they need to hire all new staff. And when I complained, I got attitude from the manager. Worst McDonald's."
"An ""A-OK"" McDonalds... if you're leaving the Strip and need to stop by McDonalds for some breakfast (or quick lunch/dinner), this is a decent place to stop by. The seating is a bit strange as they've replaced the normal tables and benches with what looks to be an attempt for a more modern look... but it makes the seating a bit uncomfortable. The food tastes like standard McDonald's food and the staff were generally nice."
"Not the best you'll find but not the worse either. Î¾I'm here for the vanilla shake. Î¾Nice Harley-Davidson theme inside (not sure what the connection is). Î¾And I'm really here for some International tid-bits:Let's try Austria.McDonald's launched two noodle offerings in Austria in 2012. Î¾This was a world premiere to test consumer demand for the Asian dish.""McNoodles"" went on sale at its Austrian restaurants in a test, set to last two to three months.The meals feature noodles with vegetables, chicken, salad and either sweet-and-sour or curry sauce, and will cost around 4.99 euros ($6.56).The company said it hoped to tap a trend toward noodle dishes and show off its ability to innovate by launching the products, which it will import from Thailand.Three-quarters of the products sold by McDonald's Austria are developed locally, and the latest experiment was prompted by the growing popularity of noodle dishes there.U.S.-based McDonald's has 179 restaurants in Austria that generated sales of 515 million euros last year."
Came here on a short re-feul from gambling all night/morning - breakfast never tasted so good (that I can remember).Bottomline: it seemed pretty clean in here. It's a McDonald's.
"I wouldn't give any stars if I could. We were in line through the drive-thru for 5 minutes. The lady asked us what we wanted and we started to order, then all of a sudden she says ""Hold on"". Couple pulled up behind us, then someone pulled up in the 2nd lane. The drive-thru lady asked the 2nd lane ""How may I help you?"" We waited a little longer to see if anyone would help us, but NO ONE DID!!! So we drove through and went to Wendy's instead. SCREW YOU MCDONALDS!!!"
Rude staff and cold fries! I would have given one star but the inside looks nice. Modern and clean. My friend was told she could get iced coffee with her meal with no extra charge then was charged $1 extra.
"Where do I start... Oh yeah. The people watching at this place is wonderful. The abundance of tweekers and crackheads is amazing. With that aside, it's a Mcdonalds! That's all I have to say about the food. The service was not good at all , the staff seemed overwhelmed with a small lunch rush. My order was missing a hamburger ( the main part of one of the meals I ordered), an apple juice (part of a kids meal) and cup for one of the drinks. They did fix it quickly. Oh there was an employee in the dinning area making the floor super sticky ( I think she was mopping with a mop bucket that had cleaned up a spilled soda, just a guess) so that was nice. So I would definitely would not recommend you try this particular McDonald's. Î¾In and out it's just across the street."
Very slow taking the order and giving me the order when it was done. It was the middle of the night and a few people there.
"The worst McD's EVER! Î¾Took 20 min for 2 coffees, & they couldn't get it right. Î¾Everything about it was bad, slow, irritating."
If I could give no stars that would describe this store. Manager was very rude order was not correct and tried to say that's what we ordered. I asked for my money back and to cancel the order and was told no refund. I did get my refund and promised I would never be back
"Sad to say, I have seen worse. Î¾It's convenient and relatively fast. Just not clean as it could be.The staff here are almost as depressed as the homeless people you find hanging around it"
"Typical McDonald's. Î¾I like this location because it is an easy to get just off the strip location. Î¾It is perfect for a quick inexpensive breakfast. Î¾Drive-thru is on pair with most ""quick drive-thru's"". Î¾Interior is Harley-Davidson themed for those that like to look at things while they wait for food."
"I usually have no issues coming here. I usually come in the morning before work for coffee. This time I came with my family and ordered four meals with iced coffees. I asked the drive thru lady for a couple packs of mayonnaise. She left the window, came back & handed me one pack of mayonnaise. I had to calm myself down.. Knowing how I am... I decided to just use my mayo at home for our burgers. What in your right mind would u think I could do with ONE baby pack of mayo for four burgers. Not even two... But hands one to me out the window. Lazy ass girl."
"This McDonald's is a dirty, busy and chaotic experience. Typically there's one register open and when your number is called for your order you're missing a drink or too. I've had the chicken club sandwich ordered crispy and received it as grilled. Breakfast consisted of old oil fried hash browns and a decent iced mocha but it took me 10 minutes to get my order. The bathrooms are also dirty and missing the feminine waste receptacles in the stalls half the time. When an employee decides to clean there's mop water sloshed all over the place."
Worst McDonald's by far. It always smells like sewage and the food is alway old. When you tell someone about it's like an inconvenience to them. I can't believe the manager is actually the manager. She has the personality of a rock. There are only a small amount of great employees here.
"This location is extremely slow, the order is usually wrong, and the food taste old. They obviously don't change their fryer oil often enough. They also need to find a better way to count their tills. I don't have 15 minutes in the morning to sit at a window and wait. I would skip this place. There are better ones around."
"Always busy, food usually cold. Sigh."
"I totally understand that this is McDonalds and you get for what you pay, but the professionalism here needs major work. While I am waiting for my food, it would be nice not to hear yelling and workers horse-playing behind the register and in front of the store. I thought going inside would be faster since there was a line of cars circling that awful drive thru, but really I think we had waited longer going inside."
"Really it should be 2.5 stars. Î¾They have the dumbest set up for a drive through. Î¾It runs the length of the regular parking area. Î¾If the line for the drive through is long, they block parking spaces and you can't get in nor out! Î¾I ended parking away from the store and walking. Î¾Service was fast and polite! Î¾I think I'd skip this place for another McDonald's unless I really needed the coffee or food."
"Understaffed, slow service, coupled with a dirty interior. The trash had been overflowing for at least 20 minutes. The store is far too small for the location."
"This McDonalds is terrible. I don't expect much from fast food but there is a standard... a low one but at least reach minimal expectations. Î¾ My son and I went through the drive through (took forever). They have the nerve to ask ""is everything on the screen correct"". Î¾After we got our food, we pulled forward in the drive-thru to allow traffic to move. Î¾I explained to my son that we need to check and make sure we got everything.... Î¾ I ordered big Mac meal and happy meal -burger plain. Î¾ They missed the toy and my fries and his burger... how? Î¾We went inside and had to convince them that we really didn't get everything. They got what we were missing and we went home. Î¾ My son was disappointed. Î¾I ordered burger plain for a reason. Î¾They were too busy chatting behind the counter to pay attention to the order they already screwed up. No apology. Nothing. Î¾ I would let this slide if this was the only time. Hire people that work! Î¾I don't expect a five star meal but get the order right. If not the first time, at least don't screw it up twice!"
"When it's busy they shouldn't be using only 1 register, other than that they have an okay customer service."
"Well I was reluctant to go into a 2 star mcdonalds, but it wasn't all that bad. Inside was relatively nice, and the employees were pretty friendly. Of the breakfast meal I got, I only changed the coffee to a large iced coffee, and got a large hot coffee instead. When I spoke out loud to myself saying ""oh is this hot?"" She thought I was just asking if I would burn myself hahaI didn't bring it up because iced coffees are usually more expensive anyway. Either way, the sausage egg biscuit was pretty good!"
"Finally left early enough for work to allow me to get a McD's coffee. I don't like the fancy coffees, just regular coffee with cream. I decided to be quick, avoid the drive-thru and go inside. My luck there was one person ahead of me, while there were at least 5 cars waiting outside. I liked the counter displays. They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch. Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work. My disappointment came when I realized that the coffee tasted bitter. Burnt. Ugh. I will try another McD's closer to work next time. What a let down."
Second time I have gone through Drive-Thru and ordered Chicken Nuggets for my nephew. Î¾They always forget the sauce. Î¾Called to let them know it has happened twice. Î¾The girl on the other end of the line said to check before I leave that it's in there. Î¾ I am paying for a product and checking to see that someone else has done their job. Î¾Sad.
"This has gotta be the cheapest McDonalds in McDonalds history, they never give napkins at the drive through. I ordered 5 sandwiches and five large fries, asked for extra ketchup and was given 2 packets and told that was the maximum they can give me. When I asked the girl at the drive thru four the manager she got all pissy and threw a handful of Î¾ketchup in the bag and asked ""happy now?"".needless to say it's a terrible place to order food"
"While seeing my food sit at the drive through window, I watched as the lady preferred to attend the coffee maker and then after taking her time I finally got my food as she handed me the food waiting at the window.... I could have left way before that! My fries suck and the nuggets are rock hard!"
It is McDonald's what else can you say.
"This McDonald's is very clean. I don't eat fast food often,but I have returned to this location a few times.I can say the people who work here are nice and very fast. The only thing that is not great are the restrooms are old but it is in a gas station."
"This has got to be by far the worst mcdolalds that was ever created number one they never give you the right order number two they don't understand English number three they use their bare hands to prepare the food number four they make mistakes on your order and give you the attitude like if you did something wrong to them . It seriously is a misery to be in their store and the people who work in there give horrible costumer service & a little bit to rude to costumers , every restaurant should respect their costumers because if it's not for us you all wouldn't have a job !"
"Came here this morning around 2:30-3am with my friends through the drive thru, the guy refused to do two separate orders, was rude about it too, no one was behind us. And he forgot the ranch I paid for last minute. I will never go back while he is working , I'm an ex mcdonalds worker and never acted like that or else I'd get a write up / termination because they are not looking for rude people !"
"I stopped here to use the Redbox machine. Î¾I then went inside and got a McDonald's McCaf’© frapp’©, chocolate chip variety.Service was prompt with a nice smile from the young lady at the counter. Î¾She made the drink quickly and it was very good. Î¾I've been here a few times in the past and it's a convenient stop on Flamingo."
"Not sure why this McDonald's is showing as closed. It is connected to the Terrible's gas station and still in business. They have a 24 hour drive-thru as well.I have never been inside, only ordered at the drive-thru. The employees are pretty friendly, they have fast service, and no problems with my orders so far. Î¾I love the $1 large sweet teas!!I moved to the area a few weeks ago and have driven by here before, but could not remember if I saw a sign saying that they had a 24 hour drive-thru. So the first time I came here, I asked the cashier at the first window:Me: Is your drive-thru 24 hours?Employee: Ummm...... I think so? But I'm not sure. Do you want me to ask? Me: That's okay, I'll ask at the next window.LOL he works there and didn't know what their drive-thru hours were?!?! Come on!! Well, as I drove up to the second window to get my food, I saw the 24 hour sign. But still, as an employee, you should at least know what the restaurant's hours are right??"
"Omg this McDonald's is so rude, they don't smile and they look like they hate everyone. They always get my order wrong and I've been there only 3 times. Don't go here bad customer service."
"I came here to order a big Mac, (hadn't had one in years) and when I got it I kinda noticed it looked like crap so I decided to inspect it. When I did, and I took off the top bun I found that someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I mean seriously I always tolerate the crappy service, and the stupid and careless Mexican lady that always takes my orders wrong ( I'm also a Mexican I promise I'm not racist or prejudice) in the mornings at the drive-thru, but c'mon seriously someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I took it back to the register, and informed the cashier of my surprise, and he was kind enough to replace it for another Big Mac. I brought it back to my table, and I took it out of it's box, and guess what? It looked like shit! Seriously this thing looked so bad I wouldn't be surprised if it fucking winked at me! It looked as if an elephant had sat on it after it had finished taking a slim dump between two hamburger buns. Okay, now I know McDonalds isn't a five star restaurant, and I definitely know it isn't even a quality restaurant, but can't the customer at least expect some service quality? I mean seriously I couldn't even expect to receive a semi-attractive decent tasting burger or a Big Mac with its Patty as a whole. Ugh.. what can you do right? Î¾GOD BLESS AMERICA"
"9 times out of 10 the service or food or both are horrible. Î¾After getting my entire order wrong I waited while they made the correct meals. Î¾At home 1 block away my meals were cold, hamburger looked and tasted like yesterdays. Î¾The fries limp and loaded with oil. Î¾If you can not get fresh fries at lunch time, when can you get it. Î¾We will skip this McDonald it never improves"
"Good service, food orders are always spot-on, and it's quick to boot. Î¾For McDonald's, that seems to be extraordinary!But seriously, their Drive-Thru is 24/7 and since it's down the street from my house that's fabulous if I come home in the wee hours. Î¾Or, if I need to grab a quick bite before I drink spirits. Î¾;)There's one guy there that's always extra-friendly and actually checks my ID -- on the back of my card it says ""See ID."" Î¾A+ to you, dude.P.S. Fries have always been crazy fresh (and we all know that's the best thing about McD's!)"
"Another rippoff but then what are the options for breakfast at 4am. As much as they charge for a Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit and 1 lityle 2-inch piece of Bacon. REALLY? This place sucks and I should have stsyed away. Make sure to count your change too!"
"I don't understand why an intelligent human being would go to this place and consume the stuff that this place sells. It is of less quality than the stuff they feed inmates at that tent prison in Arizona...literally. What McDonalds does is take some low quality beef, add soy and other mixtures for filler, and then flavor it with addictive chemical flavorings that they make in a lab. Look into it if you don't believe me. I cringe when my kids want to go there. It's so foul and not to mention freaking expensive. It's totally unbelievable to me that people eat there!"
"While outside it is advertised as a 24 hour drive thru, I waited 15 minutes with no service."
"Another national chain spot that has no reviews. And with good reason. It's pretty pointless to review a McDonald's. That is, unless you want the FTR!McDonald's to me is good for one thing--their dollar menu. I'm a sucker for the $1 McDouble and maybe some fries. On road trips, the $1 one-price-fits-all-sizes fountain drink is priceless. Unfortunately, not all McDonald's locations stick to this pricing structure, but this location certainly does.I've never actually been inside, but their drive-thru has the nice face-to-face three-window system. I'm not sure you need that third window just for ordering, but whatever. It works."
I have stayed away from most fast food places for last few years. Was running late and ordered an egg mc muffin.....worst breakfast ever.
All I can say is this is the only McDonalds that charges you $1.20 for substituting sausage for bacon on the Big Breakfast. All they give you is one and a half slices!!
I go here so much that I'm starting to never want to go again. It's the closest and cheapest food place to my house. Î¾It's cheap which I love and it's pretty good. It's McDonald's nothing special. Just cheap decent food when I need it. It's really fast too.
"It's McDonalds, what else do you want to hear from me?Oh yeah, this place has a face-to-face drive thru. Î¾You don't speak to some crappy little speaker but to an actual person when you place your drive thru order."
Typical McDonalds food not much nutrition their breakfast is good and the service is quick in this particular McDonald's customer service is very very good I have to eat fast food this would be the one I would come to
"A shiny, bronzed group of Chicken McNuggets with formed pretend-tatoes in a 4-color box served by a high-school student or college intern and a toy to boot?? From the drive-thru even? Where can I Î¾pay money?? I Î¾want to pay real money for this! And afterward, I Î¾want to gas up my car, yup! Then I Î¾want to play bad vintage top 40 music blasting on my factory car radio system ""I Î¾wanna be a cowboy. And you can be my cowgirl.""I Î¾showed up at 430am looking for a quarter pounder and they were only serving breakfast, even though the sign says differently. Another time I Î¾showed up at 1030am and tried to order breakfast and they stopped serving breakfast.I Î¾really think this Mickey D's is cray cray adorbs. 4 r e al z."
Worst McDonald's. Waited in line forever.. Finally got up to the window and they ask me to pull over to the second lane an they'll bring my food to me when it's ready. Wow I have to wait for a kids meal?! 10 mins too. Ridiculous.
Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's.
"After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango. Î¾I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack. Î¾Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy. Î¾Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88."
"This isn't even a legitimate McDonald's... It's a gas station McDonald's!I've been to this location twice. Once to meet up a stranger off Craigslist and once to try and redeem my Big Mac LivingSocial coupon. The place is clean, but the location attracts some of the local bums in the area. The smell of urine is simply unappealing. I also tried to redeem my LivingSocial coupon. They wouldn't accept it, because they couldn't find a button on the menu for it. Lame. A little about my credentials:I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."
This place is very hit and miss to me come on it's McDonald's not a five-star restaurant I Î¾understand but classic whoever's working determines on quality of food or them to get your order correct
This place is so unprofessional! The girl at the cashier didn't even make eye contact. It's not the customers fault that the employees are unhappy. Will not visit this location again!
"I have to tell you it's been 2 years since I've been at a McDonalds and all I got was a Coffee Frap, it was gross, felt greasy in my mouth...like their food. Which I haven't eaten in probably 4 years and regretted it then. It's so gross!Haven't had a Shamrock Shake in years...it's that time of year and wanted to give it a shot. Used the drive thru, there was hardly a wait. Staff was pleasant but the stench of moth balls was unbearable when they opened the drive up window. Yuk! Thankfully the shake didn't taste like the smell of the store. Not really minty, it was okay, nothing special. I'm over the Shamrock shake. Lets see how long it'll be this time till I make it to another McDonalds."
"ahhhhh just got home after getting drive thru at this location. i really considered turning around and going back but gave up on the thought. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of BBQ sauce. heres what i gota spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere. a medium fry that was literally half full, honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating, it was about a third full. and guess what no BBQ sauce BUT an open ketchup packet that got everywhere. BRAVO... BRAVO. and this is why i rarely eat fast food."
Its a McDonald's attached to a gas station so you cant expect much. Food was ok as you cant screw that up to bad at a franchise restaurant. You do have to put up with the horrible parking lot/ gas station traffic if you park and go in the dinning room is loud/small with tons of little kids running around (no playground for the kids and the parents seem to let them run wild)Napkins are by the register not by the the straws or the soda machine so make sure you grab a few when you pay for your meal or you will have to push your way to the front to get them afterwards. There are other McDonalds near by and you are better off visiting one of them.
"A first for the gf and I - a visit to McDonald's ! Î¾Surprisingly, out of the blue, the gf was recovering from the flu and said she was craving McDonald's french fries. Î¾Before i could get out the door to make a Mickie-D run the gf yells out asking for a filet of fish, "" anything else ? "" , she calls out for a chocolate shake, too. Î¾Yep, I guess she's feeling better !So i order:Large Fries - $2.09Chocolate Shake - $2.79Filet of Fish - $3.7920 piece chicken nuggets - $4.99Diet coke - $1.00My first thought - dang, Mickie d's ain't all that cheap, $3.79 for a filet of fish ?! Î¾Seems high to me.The taste ? Î¾Holy cow - some of the worst food we've had in a very long time ! Î¾My guess is the nuggets were sitting out for several hours - we ate 4 of them and stopped. Î¾The fries were limpy, wimpy, limpy. Î¾The filet of fish was ok at best. Î¾Shake was ok. Î¾This is a reminder why the only reason i hit McDonald's is for a soda - best value and basically a safe bet !"
"This McDonald's is connected to the Terrible's convenience store/gas station and not particularly one of my favorites.It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby.The last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen. Î¾Apparently she was on break (and eating) and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues, so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they, in turn, hollered back. Î¾Very professional group here.I'm sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well."
"OK. so. Î¾When we first moved here..... We had a bunch of friends visit and come stay at our brand new house back in 2008? Î¾I don't remember... a while back. Î¾But this joint was still fairly new. Î¾We came here on the way to the airport to drop off our weekend guests at the McCarran for a quick bite to eat. Î¾[Keep in mind that this is during the summertime]So we go in.. and there are flies. Î¾FLIES. Î¾all over the place. Î¾I'm weirded out and the employees are acting like nothings wrong. Î¾I'm not sure what to do at this point and I've suddenly lost my appetite. Î¾So I approach the counter and I ask... what's going on? Î¾And the young man at the counter was at a loss and kinda giving me the ""get out of here"" look. Î¾So, I made a judgement call and decided that we needed to get out of there. Î¾I'm not talking about 1 or 2 flies that the auto door can bring in. Î¾It was like walking through a wall. O_O Î¾Next.... I should say that I have been back. Î¾BUT. . . Î¾years later and not after I put in a call to let the proper people know that there was a HUGE problem.... it's not always the cleanest either. I haven't encountered that problem since.... but, still not the first one I'd go to though it IS RIGHT there."
This location is part of a gas station and has not been updated in years. The food is alright but there are always flies flying around in the dinning room which is pretty unappetizing to say the least. You would think someone there would have noticed by now as I have seen the flies on several occasions.
"The Drive Thru sucks. I mean the food comes out quickly. And Whether ordering inside or in your car you get it fast. A plus being you can hit the convenience store and get gas or snacks. But literally the drive thru dumps you at the entrance and exit on Rainbow blvd and its hard to get out. And if you come in the wrong way, you have to flip a u turn to get into the drive thru. To late for them to redo it now. I guess when im on that side of town, ill venture inside from now on."
"This is a prime location for residents of Mountains Edge sitting on such a busy corner. Î¾The fries here are always tasteless and soggy, they are slow to move the drive through along and parking is difficult based on the building configuration. Î¾If I feel like grabbing a #2 value meal I much rather travel to the McDonalds 4 miles North on Rainbow."
This review is only for the one in Rainbow and Blue Diamond of SouthWest Vegas. Î¾I go here because it's one of the few Mcdees thats open 24hrs. Î¾Menu and taste is the same as the other Mcdees around town. Î¾Would have gotten one more star if they served breakfast before 5am because I went at 4:40am and they were just doing the lunch menu still. They denied me of a good warm hearty breakfast and had to settle for an unhealthy BIG MAC combo with a coke.
Employees more worried about gossiping than serving customers. Almost 5 am and I waited 8 minutes for 2 breakfaat Î¾sandwiches. This place is a joke.
"I haven't been to a McDonalds in years. Î¾Now I remember why. Stopped at Redbox and decided to grab a hot fudge sundae while I was there.Got to watch a manager argue with a customer over whether she ordered fries or not, and on the way out noticed an overflowing garbage can with garbage all over the floor in the dining room. Î¾Stay Klassy McDonald's."
"This review is only for the drive through. I enjoy the face to face ordering instead of the intercom. It gives a better chance for them to get your order correct. The staff here is very nice. There are a few people I can think of who are not morning people and should not be working the drive through, but I can't really choose who's working the window. The wait time depends on when you actually order. It's a little longer in the morning when everyone is off to work and when people are getting off work. As for my actual orders, I haven't had an order incorrect, although they have forgotten a straw here and there or have forgotten sauce or ketchup. I just make sure everything is there before I drive off. Food wise, it's McDonald's. Nothing special."
"Make sure they put everything, you've ordered, in the bag before leaving! We went through the drive-tru and ordered six burgers (we were both hungry). Î¾We get to the second window, and the guy handing my boyfriend the bag repeated the order, but he said five burgers instead of six, so my boyfriend said, ""How many? Five?"" And the guy said, ""No, six."" So, we drive off without checking how many were actually in the bag, and when we got home, we find out there were only five. Ugh!!! And we did check the receipt, and under QTY - 6!McDonald's, you guys owe me a damn burger!"
"BEWARE: There is a guy who works here, tall, glasses and painfully forgetful. I've gone here a total of three times in the past month for a quick fix with my siblings and he's gotten our order wrong each of those times. He must be new, but he does seem genuinely sorry after he adds or subtracts something from our order.Regardless, he's not why I give this McDonalds 1 star.This place is usually jam packed with teens by 1pm during the school year and during the summer, just can't catch a break. Location is usually messy and has THE LOUDEST DOOR EVER! Service is mediocre to the max, then again, this is McDonalds, no 5 star review here."
"It's McDonald's. You really can't ever expect a good meal from any McDonald's. That said, however, I have no complaints about this location. My order has always been correct and speedy. And the food here is no worse than the food at any other McD's location. So can I really give it fewer than 3 stars? I guess not.Psst...want to know what my favorite thing is from McD's? It's the hot mustard sauce. I could dip practically anything in that sauce. It is so yum!"
"I hate Mcdonald's I go tto be really really Hungry to eat there but my kids like it. This location service is what u expect from Mikey D's, nothing more nothing less."
"I am truly unimpressed with this location. I LOVE a cup of coffee in the morning and McDonalds has great coffee. This location seems to be run by a bunch of children with no other purpose other than goofing off. I sound like my father. How hard is it to be polite and serve a cup of coffee? With a thousand locations within a 5 mile radius, I think a will drive and extra block or two for that great cup of coffee."
I was just there a few days ago. Î¾I ordered my daughter a kids meal thru the drive thru. Î¾The women at the first window was very nice and professional. Î¾When we drove to the next window to pick up our food the women just handed us the juice then handed up our kids meal. Î¾The whole time talking to fellow coworkers. Î¾We saw only the back of her the whole time. Î¾No hello no thank you or anything. Î¾It was the weirdest thing. Î¾My husband and I were shocked that happen. Î¾Sorry Mcdonalds we were bothering you. Î¾The funny thing I think she was the manager because she was wearing a different color than everyone else.
"If you're looking for a quick breakfast, you really can't go wrong with a breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee from McDonald's Î¾ This location is always quick...I've never had any issues with my orders or the employees here. Î¾I've only had breakfast here so I can't comment on the rest of their menu.My mom told me their oatmeal is really good...planning on trying that next time. Î¾My husband also loves their cinnamon roll bites."
Slowest McDonalds ever....especially in the mornings
"OK McDonald's...Please check your beverage dispensing machine. On several occasions, I've had poorly mixed coke from your unit. The coke taste watered down. Are you trying to save on cost or did you run out of product? Î¾Never compromise on my Coca Cola drinks, I would hate to cross over to another brand. Restaurants should be mindful of their dispensing units to ensure their lines have full bag in the box running through the lines and keep the ice maker full of ice. Thank you!"
this mcdonalds was SUPER fancy looking on the inside and outside- it was pretty unusual to see. otherwise it was a pretty standard mcdonalds. kinda slow service here though.
"I'm constantly disappointed in this mcdonalds and it's the closest one to me sadly . But today was just the last leg for me , I guess my order was too complicated no onion no pickle on a cheese burger w/ melted cheese ( because most times the cheese is not melted ) and my receipt had my order correct but my burger still came with onions and pickles . So I went inside and waited for a new one to be prepared . Only to watch the lady preparing my food give me sooo much attitude , and cover my burger in ketchup . I just left the burger there , customer service was piss poor today . And every other day . Everyone looked miserable ."
"Heading into the Galleria to shoe shop with the wife, she figured it would be beneficial to get me a snack before the doldrums of shoe shopping. Thought the dollar menu should be an inexpensive snack before we went home for a full dinner.It was an easy transaction to get a soda, burger and fries, they're order fulfillment time was about the highlight of the visit.Our food was ready, so we sat down and tore into the bag. The burger was your typical McD's burger, nothing special, tastes like a very cheap, almost beef patty. The fries however, looked and tasted like they had been dropped into the fryer a couple times. Finally, the soda... there was a slightly off taste to it, could be the mix, or the syrup was on its way out, either way, it wasn't the greatest tasting soda I have had.After eating, I went to get my drink refilled, as they normally give one refill per cup at this location. Not this time. Now, if you would like a refill, it is $0.54. I was really tempted to break out the credit card to pay for a refill, just out of spite. Laziness prevailed and I walked away. I can understand not having unlimited refills at a mall, where mallrats could abuse the refill policy. That is why it was perfectly understandable to have only one refill per cup."
"I'm not ashamed to admit that every once in a while, I get a Bic Mac Attack and have to have some McDonald's. Î¾Well, it happened last weekend while I was at the Galleria Mall to watch the B-Boy Battle Swagger competition.I ordered a Big Mac and one of the new Angus Beef Bacon Cheeseburgers. Î¾To wash it down, I ordered a bottle of Water.....hey, I had to do something healthy to not feel so bad, right?The food came out on time, but they were out of bottled Water....so they gave me the one on display.....huh?! I thought it was hilarious.Anyway, I got my Big Mac fix and thought the Angus Bacon Cheeseburger was alright.Will I return? Î¾Only during the next Big Mac Attack."
I love the Ice cream here! Thats the only thing I get when I go to mcdonalds.
Hav to pay for refill......use to be free but they got cheap.
"This particular location has by far the worst service overall. I am not lying when I say that 7 out of 10 visits whether it be drive-thru or walk-in, something is wrong with my order. I can remember my order for extra onions on McRib sandwiches or hamburgers have been produced with extra pickles and no onions. A recent visit took 25 minutes to produce a 10 piece chicken mcnuggets and a soda. I've worked at a McDonald's before, and if I had a valid food card, and ambassadorial privileges, I could have changed the oil, re-heat the fryer, located a box in their freezer, and fry my own food, and still get to school on time. The shift manager gave me a large fries and 2 cups for drinks, not being sensitive to the fact that I had diabetes, and I had ordered nuggets for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbs.The service today was not as bad, but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do I want with my nuggets if they aren't going to give it to me? The guy at the window actually tried to shove me out of drive-thru with only a partial order. This particular instance has happened several times.Unfortunately, I am a fan of their products, and when I get a hankering and wish not to get out of my vehicle, this is the closest location.I have managed 3 food service installations, and I guarantee that I could run that place better than the current crew, given minimal training.I would say the 80's had lousy fashion, 90's had lousy music, and so far, aside from drivers of today, customer service is at its worst, especially for food service and more especially for McDonald's on Sunset and Stephanie."
"Status upon arrival: Hungover, Starving, Filthy, 3 hours of sleep.Even though McDonalds is known to be fast food as in fast service, we love to request our Angus burgers fresh upon order. (waiting the extra 10 minutes) Okay, so we starved more than we had to, but finally after receiving our food, the first thing my cousin noticed was how old the patties were. Little did they know my cousin worked at McD's for over two years.If your going to give us crap anyways, give a lame excuse instead of having your customers starve for no reason. This branch definitely failed to meet our hunger satisfaction."
"Hands down worst McDonald's we've ever visited. Fairly nice employees, but:- slow service: the place was almost empty, but it took nearly 20 minutes to get our food- low quality ingredients: my prepackaged side salad was filled with wilted iceberg and dry carrot shavings- inconvenient: you have to ask for them to unlock the bathrooms, and you have to show a receipt for refills- poor service: they were ""out"" of water cups (even though they just gave one to the guy before me), and wouldn't give me something else for water instead"
7/12/14 @12:15 had lunch here! Everyone & everything was on point. I've had so many bad experiences at Mc Donalds but for these guys I decided to make a yelp account just for this! Chicken nuggets and fries were perfectly crispy and the whole drive through crew was amazingly nice and they got our order right which is a gigantic plus in my book. Thanks for making our stay in Vegas even better! Going again today! Hehehe
"The worst mc Donald's in Las Vegas trust me I love here. I been there many times because I use to go to school down the street from there and every single time, every single time, they gave me the wrong order or didn't give me my drink or had to wait 20 minutes for my order. To make it worst the drive thru is not fast by any means either, ur looking at at least 15 minutes over the limit. It's on a busy location but they don't seem to care because the place is always dirty, napkins on the floor and ketchup all over the tables; to make it worse the restrooms are disgusting. If you are hungry don't go here at all, at all!!! No customer service and dirty as hell location"
"Had to use the drive thru, because I was on a road trip with my puppies, and it is just too darn hot in NV to leave them in the car for any reason. Î¾That said, I got an iced coffee and some fries, as that was all I could find on the menu that was vegetarian. Î¾Now I remember why I don't go here. Î¾Then I realized, if I could have only found a Taco Bell, I could have had real food!"
I bought a filet-o-fish and asked for a large cup of ice. They charged me $1 for a cup of ice...fail!
"I really don't like McDonalds in general. But in a moment of weakness, I stopped here in the middle of a long road trip. The kids were hungry and tired and we didn't want to spend any time driving around, looking for food. I wish we had looked a little more.We had an awful experience. Not only was the place very dirty, but the food was terrible. The chicken sandwiches we got were very dry and tasted like some cleaning product that should have been rinsed off the grill. The fries were cold and withered.This was my first visit to McD in at least 5 years. It will be at least that long before I try McD again."
"Every time that I go to the welcome screen on Yelp, I keep seeing ""Your next review awaits"" with a picture of Ronald McDonald patting a man I don't know. Yelp wants me to write the review and I am tired of seeing this when I go on the welcome screen. So, I will write a review on the McDonald's in Sam's Town. Î¾When I write a review I try to look at a unique aspect of the business. When it comes to fast food restaurants, it takes some thinking. What makes this McDonald's unique is that it features the exact Western motif displayed throughout Sam's Town. It is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic Mystic Falls robotic animals perform. I don't know of any McDonald's where I could grab a Big Mac and fries and watch a robotic cast of animals performing in a laser show, What also makes this McDonald;s unique for a location off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Any Size Beverage promotion. Î¾The Sam's Town McDonald's is one of a few food choices in Sam's Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffee and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald's is advantageous for a light snack or a Large Coke for the drive home. The time I spend on the line justifies a check-in. It is the McDonald's of Sam's Town, and it gets busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald's in the D casino, the employees are friendly. This summarizes my experiences for the Sam's Town McDonald's. Yelp should be happy that I wrote the review, and I should be happy to see a new picture on my welcome screen."
"Manuel, the manager, gave us the worst customer service I've every had at a McDonald's. Took our order incorrectly, blamed us for it, overcharged us, wouldn't fix it, and was rolling his eyes the whole time, tried to hide his name from us and only gave it to us when we insisted. Then didn't even apologize for any of it!"
"All I wanted was a McFlurry but 14 minutes in the drive thru made it impossible. I left empty handed and upset. Oh well, Sonic shake it is for me then! Btw, drive through lady was hard to understand, they need to hear themselves through that speaker. Simply terrible, but then again we're in the hood and the next closest location is still in the hood. Next time I'll just stop by the store and buy a tub rather than go through this hassle and headache."
I am only customer in drive thru a d I'm asked to pull over in reserve area to wait on my grilled onion burger order. The manager very polite and I never felt mistreated. However I am confused as to what the hold up was all about . Also after getting home I find hardly any onions on the burgers and out of the ordinary dry. I hate to complain as I said the staff very respectful and friendly. But the food definitely contradicts the attitudes of staff. Very disappointed and regret paying for the food even at it's low price.. Sorry guys. gotta be honest.
"I had no problem here: everything was present in my drive-thru order, and up to McDonalds' usual standards (whether you love them or loathe them)."
They never get the order right and then I have never got the large fries I order they always put smalls in the back and the wait for all this to happen is forever. Never again.
"This location is convenient in Boca Park, but be prepared to wait in the drive thru. Î¾I have visited them during peak hours and between and that doesn`t seem to matter."
"I've been a regular customer at McDonalds for some time now and recently moved to the Summerlin area. This sorry excuse for a McDonalds near my house has continued to have the worst customer service, wait time is horrible and by all means hope and pray they get your order right!!!! There is plenty of competition, I'd would be happy to take my business else where! McDonalds? What happen the the customer service and quick service?!!"
It's McDonald's. It has a drive-thru. We drove through it. The frappe produced from said drive-thru was A-OK.
This place is the worst. Always someone begging in the drive thru. Then before that you have to almost get hit to get in the drive way. Then after that your get a large and they always give you a small. The only thing they do right was hav
"This place is terrible. It's a 50/50 chance that they will get your order right. Maybe if they could hire people who spoke a word of English, they would get your orders right.I was JUST there. I wanted a coffee with no whip cream and extra caramel. Super easy, right? Apparently not. They put extra whip cream, barely any caramel. I paid extra for it, so I asked them to remake it. The girl did, but tried to give it to me with, again, barely any caramel. I explained that I asked for extra and even paid extra. She got an attitude with me, then walked away. Another girl asked her what she was going and said, ""MORE f***ing caramel!?"" So sure as shit, the girl had to be a smart ass and put as much caramel as she could. Literally, the entire bottom was filled half an inch up of caramel. I couldn't help but laugh. What an immature and ignorant staff. I will never go here again. This place is a complete dump. I will definitely be contacting the district manager, because the manager here is a joke and doesn't take anything serious."
Don't be fooled... not a great part of town. Lazy employees. Unsanitary restrooms and play area. Do not recommend this location at all! Got very sick after eating here.
"They made me wait an extra 20 minutes just so they can throw my order at me. Didn't even ask if I need napkins or condiments. I called the store and didn't even apologize, they gave me the wrong number to corporate, and then they hung up on me. I googled corporate's number, the I called corporate, and they gave me a voucher for 2 free meals."
"Horrible service!!! Every time I go to this particular location, Î¾the employees are very rude and never get the Î¾order right. Every employee there has a horrible attitude, from the cashier to the people in the kitchen to the guy on drive-thru."
"This is a large, relatively modern-looking mcds. Its a bit grimy, which in mho, kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel. Why bother making it all pretty & modern if youre not going to wipe it down regularly?The service here is ok. Food is standard mcds fare. The one reason we come here is for the HUGE four-story play area. The kids enjoy exploring it, and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity. Î¾theres a small space underneath for littler guys to play in, but this playplace is realistically more for older kids who can climb well. The kids room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant, which works great at keeping my boys from running off, and theres a separate bathroom in here just for aparents. Î¾No changing table, which for some strange reason seems to be the way las vegas restaurants roll. I really hate that. Therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seats since theres nowhere else to do it.Maybe then they'll wipe it down afterwards... But dont count on it."
