The only reason I come here every now and then, is because it's close to our home. Otherwise, this place is known to mess up your drive-thru order.
We always see this place as we go into Super Walmart to shop and its always busy. So we decided to try them out after we shopped.Bad!! The floors were dirty, the customer service was nothing to talk about and the fries tasted like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long while.FYI just because they are always busy doesn't mean they are good. McDonalds of all places!!!!
So it's fast food and McDonalds at that. Î¾So let's say expectations are very, very low. Sometimes though you just want food that's fast and you know what to expect. Not every meal can be a 5 star dinner with an executive chef.Even with appropriate low expectations, this location takes the cake for subpar service. Î¾About a week ago I was exhausted and needed something to eat and there are few fast food restaurants near where I live. So off to McDonalds I went. Î¾Ordered a value meal and a single apple pie. Î¾Surprise...no pie! Î¾Ok, mistakes happen. I've worked drive through in a previous life and I get it. Î¾Even though it was 10 pm and I was the only car there, so it's not like they were rushed. Î¾Still...mistakes happen.Fast forward to tonight. Î¾Again about 10 pm and exhausted and decide to go crazy and get McD's twice in 1 week. Î¾So I try again to order an apple pie with my value meal. Î¾Now, maybe this is my fault, because I should have checked the bag before driving off. Î¾But after sitting at the window and waiting for 5 minutes (and remember, I was really tired), silly me thought they'd be able to get it straight this time.Turns out I was wrong. Î¾Yet again...no pie. Î¾Both times (within a week of each other) I paid for them. Î¾Neither time they felt it necessary to put it in the actual bag.So I called to talk to the manager. Î¾And get hung up on as soon as I ask for the manager. Î¾So I called back, the manager actually answered and I told him what happened. Î¾He didn't sound too displeased, just told me "next time we'll get your order right."Yeah, if there IS a next time.
I know what your thinking...."another 1 star review for McD's and you don't even eat there?!? What gives?" Well I have to say this is an "informative" review! Getting right down to it. I was out running by a few client sites today when I stopped and picked up lunch at Riverside (that's right, be jealous). Î¾So, a coworker calls and asks if I would pick up lunch for her. Î¾Being a team player I said no problem. She then told me she wanted Satan...I mean McDonalds. I sighed, but agreed. She told me what she wanted and off I went. Oh and to get some ketchup and Sweet and Sour sauce. Mkay. I pulled up to the drive thru and ordered after they tried to sell me their new Angus Burger. (Sidenote: Why do they do that in the first place? I mean, if that is what I wanted, I would have ordered it.) "May I please have #12 with a Sprite." "Would you l like to add on an apple pie for $.50?" "Um, no." "$7.01, please pull up to the first window." So I pay. Drive to window #2. Man opens the window hands me the drink and the bag of food. I asked for a S&S Sauce packet. The guy responded. "We charge for that now." "Ha, that's hilarious. Just one please." "No really, they are $.28" "What? You're kidding right?" "No ma'am, if you want one you'll have to pull back around the drive thru." (Totally dumbfounded I say) "Do you charge for ketchup too?" Then drive off. Î¾I laugh the entire way back to work like a crazy woman..."What do you mean your charging for condiments? " "Is it laced with heroin?" "Are there diamonds inside these packets?" "Is charging for this even legal?" I mean it wasn't even my order and I'm mad as hell. They've managed to piss me off again. Congrats McSatan. You officially suck more than ever. Take your Sweet and Sour Sauce and shove it where the sun don't shine. *spits on ground*
The drive-thru menu board has changed making it impossible to find the items I usually order. Î¾Not sure if its just this location or all McDonalds, anything with mayonnaise will have enough mayo for three sandwiches and enough bread for almost 6 sandwiches compared to the amount of meat. If you request mustard instead of mayonnaise make sure you ask for mustard at the second window because you're getting dry sandwiches.
Terrible customer service. Rude and indifferent manager. My friends and I go there to purchase food and I asked for a courtesy cup of water as it was very hot and I didn't want soda. She looked me square in the eye in front of everyone and said "no". That will cost you $.27 cents. Not even after I had patronized the business could I not have a sip of water? Really? I will never shop at that McDonald's ever again. Any McDonalds really. I actually watched the manager and she treated every minority who walked in like crap.
Definitely not a fan of this McDonald's. Ordered a Big Mac the other day and the sandwich looked like someone sat on it.I've seen better quality of sandwiches from other locations in Dallas.
Check your order! Î¾ Yet again they shortchanged me on my large order leaving out one of the big chicken sandwichesDon't bother calling to fix it as no one answersBy far the worst McDonalds in the area.Update; Î¾ Spent 15 minutes getting my refund and the manager even shorted me on that. Î¾ Lesson learned count your change toi
I wouldn't even give this NASTY place one star! Î¾I went thru the drive-thru and my order was wrong, because the woman taking my order could hardly speak English. Î¾I ordered a McChicken without mayo add mustard and she kept asking me a McChichen add mayo, mustard and onions? I said no, finally got my order right on the screen pay and then go to get my food and its WRONG! so I go back thru the line and she apologies and I back to the window to get my food for the 2nd time and guess what its wrong again! Î¾I parked my car walked inside and I have no clue where the manager was but I was totally grossed out at how nasty this place was. Î¾Not only was the staff rude but it looks like the place hadn't been cleaned. Î¾This place must be a daycare for all the Mexican kids in the area because they was running around screaming throwing stuff and just trashing the place out. There was 3 adults in the whole place and about 20-30 kids just acting a damn mess! Î¾While sitting at my seat I seen what looked like 2 drug deals go one. Î¾I saw a tall black man walk in pants hanging off his ass and a wife beater (looked so damn nasty) he would stand by the door people would pull in a car he would run out to the window trade something off and come back in and stand by the door and then do the same actions all over again. Î¾When I went to get more soda I noticed there was no lids (go figure) and so I asked the worker he replied to me sorry I am going on break. Î¾This store needs to be shut down and the owner needs to think about what type of place he wants representing him. Î¾This place should be called El McGhetto because that is all it is.
It's a pretty dirty McDonald's, I probably had one two many drinks and needed a chocolate shake so I huffed it down to McDonalds. Would I visit McDonalds again? Unfortunatly... no matter how disgusted I am with myself after each visit I always come crawling back...
"Hello, would you like to try our hot chocolate?"Oh man, how I hate the prerecorded message at this drive-thru. NO, I do NOT want the hot chocolate. No, I do NOT want the frappe fizz. NO, I do NOT want whatever piece of crap food item you are happening to push at the present moment ...I DO NOT WANT IT!I only WANT what I order and what I came in to purchase.When WILL you get that? In the morning, this is the busiest McDonalds I have ever come across. Usually, there's a line in the drive-thru snaking into the street. The parking lot is poorly designed, making it difficult to leave once you grab your order. The loop comes full circle, and you're blocked by people in a secondary line entering from Belt Line road northbound.Just give me my freakin' egg biscuit, cut the high pressure up-selling, and let me get the heck out of here ...
I come here so often for lunch and every time I been here they alway get my order wrong, either I'm always missing something or I add bacon to a burger and get charged for it and it's not on a burger I would check and open it up but I don't have time I have to get back to my job. Î¾It's so aggravating and I can't go back around because it would make me late for work I would really hope they do something about this issue! Either your cooks do not know how to read or they so not pay attention.
NO STARS First of all!!! But I am forced to give 1 star.WORST customer service and WORST of all it's been going on for years and I don't see any change in service or MANAGEMENT. I live down the street from this location and everytime I place my order I ask them to repeat it but when I get home it's not correct Î¾When I get to the drive thru window it's like I have to argue with them to present my case to convince to redo the whole order and they only want to replace what they made mistake of the item I ordered not the whole order!!!! Hell after I have to drive back to the loc for my food to get it correct, I don't Î¾want to eat cold food...this has happened to me for years now, I only go to this loc because of my kids. I have complained to Corporate and spoken to the manager but to no avail. After years of bad service and not able to convince my twins I have decided to stop going to this specific location drive 5 mile out of my way to I-30 & 360 McDonald's location where I get my order from a friendly and smiling person.
"And on the seventh day, he forsook rest, but opened THE FIRST McDONALDS to quest his famished soul, yea." Î¾I may be exaggerating on the power of Mickey Ds, but only cause they can sue. Anyway, this particular McDonalds is inside the Wal Mart on Forest Ln., and forms a nice reprieve before or after your purchases. No drive-thru, but there is another McDonalds just down the road, on Abrams, that does. Anywho, don't go here often, folks. It's nice for a forgotten lunch or a celebratory match, but don't make it a habit. Deuces, doc.
I drive up and the chick tells me, "Please wait a minute." 15 minutes later another chick comes on and tells me, "We're only according cash." WTF?!?! Crap service. What else should I have expected...
The counter girl was super rude and took 20 min for just a iced coffee
I was hopping after they spent so much money on redecorating, that this McDonald's would improve on customer service and cleanliness. BOY, WAS I WRONG!!!The family bathroom does not have a changing table, it was totally out of toilet paper, and the hand dryer was broken. I informed 2 managers of this, but they did nothing to rectify the (at least) one issue they could. There are no paper towels, just the hand dryer so one could be up the proverbial "S" creek without anything to clean up with. NASTY!!!I also informed Î¾the same managers that there were spills (one water, one bubbles) in the play area, but no one ever came to clean them and my daughter almost slipped through one of the spills. They did not even put a warning sign out. I also reiterated about the toilet paper, and took it upon myself to place napkins on the sink. The food was not hot; in fact, barely warm. The napkin used on the floor where the water spill was, was black when I cleaned the area myself, I don't work there, but should have earned a paycheck, instead of paying them for what we had.
First-I know it's a McDonald's. So what could I expect? Î¾How about a clean space and staff that at least pretended to care.This store is close to the house and our grandson wanted his birthday party here.The store had a recent makeover and on first appearances is a very nice location. They obviously spent some money on the makeover. Î¾That is why the cleanliness, or lack thereof, was rather shocking. The dining area by the children's play area appears to be an afterthought when they are cleaning. Î¾I ended up cleaning our tables myself since no one seemed to care enough to come wipe down tables Î¾or throw away trash. Î¾The food was standard fare at McDonald's but they were really slow filling the orders and it was only lukewarm when we got to the tables.The play area also had one other major issue. Î¾They have a little area with animals for the smaller kids to crawl around on. Î¾I give them points for that and trying to keep the really wee ones away from the bigger kids. Î¾I would have thought that someone would have though of affixing the animals in some way so they would not tip over when the kids were on them- a definite safety hazard.Not a store I care to revisit. Luckily my grandson is now 5 and his palate will soon outgrow McDonald's!
Being Scottish I always enjoy a jaunt to one of our name-sakes' establishments...The food is always Mickey D's--hard for that to get messed up I think. The attendant was serviceable, that's about it. The part I *really* liked was being approached, in my car, by the ned the homeless guy, jed the homeless guy, red, thehomless guy, etc.... you get the picture. My windshield has never been cleaned so many times....
Stopped in to feed the kids after the aquarium. Parking lot is relatively clean sharing a lot with a chevron. We were greeted warmly when we came to the counter and everything seemed good. Halfway thru ordering a transient came up behind me in line to ask me for money. The cashier ignored it. Then I noticed he subsequently asked every person in line behind me. The counter staff was not even showing any concern like we worked there. Food came, we got in our vehicle and a different transient appeared inches from my passenger window asking for something. The food was good, the service was good, just stay away if you dont like people accosting you for money.
I literally left this location because of the screwy parking lot. I just gave up and went to another McDonalds on the way to where I was going.
I would be hesitant to stop here except in broad daylight. Î¾Drive through line was really long, and inside wasn't moving much better. Î¾Not the cleanest McDOnald's I've been to for sure.
Either its waaayy too packed with long lines in the drive thru or the order is messed up. You say no cheese and they still add cheese.
Not the best McDonalds I've been to. Service is kind of lacking and this area in general is pretty sketchy. However, it's the closest McDonalds to my house, so to save gas I go to this one. Lately they've been getting a bit better in getting their orders right so hopefully it's a permanent change.
I've had my order messed up at this location 6 out of 10 times. I would refuse to go, but I love their iced coffees!!
As a whole this is a much nicer McD's then most I've seen and the quality seems to be pretty consistent.Cons: - CAUTION - read this!That said, the area is surrounded by government apartments and a guy was parked outside of this McD's last week and stupidly had his windows down and parked while writing a text msg on his cell when a guy put a GUN to his face and made him drive home only to rob him. Î¾Fortunately he was not harmed other than his pride.Moral of the story: be aware of your surroundings and keep your windows up and doors locked even in the drive-thru line.
We stopped by here on our way out of town to grab coffee, etc. Let me just say Ill NEVER come back. This place is completely sketchy. There's people randomly lingering around outside. Keep your windows rolled up and your doors locked while waiting. My coffee was warm but not hot as the outside label claimed. It also tasted burned. How exactly do you burn coffee? Overall, not a place Ill ever return and would not encourage anyone to visit.
I think Mc this location is quite different from Î¾another location that i had before. The quality is not good enough. I order big Mc but it is not something that i had before. By the way this restaurant serve me when i have not thing to eat.
Angus, bacon and cheese. Î¾Thats the name of the sandwich. Î¾It should come with cheese the first time.
This location is really close to where i live and we go here all the time. Poor food quality at night. You would think that the food would be fresher at night because of the slower business. I ordered a filet of fish a few times from here and I recieved a stale fish sandwich. and \ the fish look and felt so stale like it was thrown away earlier in the day and dug out the trash and put on a bun. My friend had gotten a double cheese burger and when she bit into and look at it as a piece of mop string in her burger. THAT IS DISGUSTING. We took it back got a fresh burger and fo a gift i guess they gave us free stale pies. lol "Gotta Love It"
Okay, so we all know McD's isn't the tip top of cuisine, but I like it when I am on the go and heading into work. The people at this McDonald's know me pretty well by now and always say "Hi, where ya been?" when I haven't been by for a while. They also know what I order and comment when I do something different... "no kid's meal today?" Ha Ha...I guess that makes me predictable. Point being, the staff here is friendly and the food is just McDonald's.
I give it only one star because they are slow and lazy. For religious reasons, I don't eat pork so I choose the eggs an cheese biscuit. I end up getting handed a sandwich where they removed the sausage. Not happy.
I'm not sure if the other reviewer went to this location because I found that they had friendly competent service and good quality food. Î¾The restaurant appeared clean but the vinyl on the playplace booths was badly ripped and should be replaced. Î¾Following the DFW tradition of themed playplaces, this one is a gold mine. Î¾My son had a lot of fun.
Service here is HORRIBLE! An employee there has cursed me out before and one time a manager was talking crap about us in Spanish! I SPEAK SPANISH! Food sucks butt. Don't go to this McDonalds, you'll have a bad experience and rude customer service.
I'm not a big McDonald's fan, in fact I don't like their food at all, but I was with people who wanted to eat here so I was captive. I had an Angus snack wrap which wasn't much more than a hamburger wrapped in a very small flour tortilla. It was actually pretty tasty, but what I was most impressed with was the dinning room. It looked more like an upscale English country hunting lodge. Plaid wallpaper, brass chandelier and fixtures with dark wood trim, the only thing that spoiled the atmosphere of "fine" dining was the playground with huge windows and the screams of kids at play.
This is not the Mickey D's you want to go to for fast service. Î¾We ate inside and they got our orders wrong and were super slow. Î¾They need to hire more people at this location!!!!!!!
I was informed by the Manager on 5-1-13 around 2pm that this is a franchise owned Mc Donalds and they dont have to adhere to corporate protocol such as customer service and prices. The whole atmosphere reflects this man's attitude IT'S TERRIBLE. I will never go back to this Mc Donalds location and in my opinion no one else should either. The prices are higher and the customer service is lower than the Mc Donalds on First St. and Beltilne Rd Garland, TX. Î¾Joanne must work there. THIS PLACE SUCKS !!!!!!!!! Smart a.. manager and all. He gave me the website to file a complaint on. What a joke.
I was craving fast food - hadn't had it in weeks - so I decided to try this McDonald's on my lunch break. Î¾The food sucked. Î¾The nuggets had no taste. Î¾Grease was dripping from my fries. Î¾The ice machine was out of ice. Î¾A homeless man was walking around the store begging for money. Î¾I think I'm going back to my non-Mcdonald's/non-fast food ways.
Food was ok as what would be expected from McDonald's; Î¾however, I ordered a strawberry milkshake which tasted so sickly sweet it was undrinkable. My boyfriend ordered chicken nuggets and a chocolate milkshake which is his regular. He stated that both tasted below par.Go to In and Out burger instead :)
I feel like my father right now. Î¾"I'm not mad... I'm just disappointed." Î¾I can't believe I paid for an iced Carmel mocha. It was gross and tasted like super sweet burned coffee. It wasn't served with the typical cone lid and whipped cream and fancy looking swirl of chocolate and carmel on top either. I even double checked when I received it and the clerk assured me in her best English accent that it was in-fact an "iced mocha." Î¾Wrong. I've been ordering these for awhile and this was not up to par. I believe they charged me the higher price and just gave me an iced coffee. I guess I should expect this from McDonald's. especially when their staff is still trying to master the English language. I can't expect them to understand me AND successfully complete my order. Can I?! Î¾Keep looking for another morning caffeine kick or pony up an extra couple of bucks for Starbucks across the street.
I guy named Rodrigo identified himself like a manager on Sunday morning 04/20/2014, he was talking about a costumer's dress in front of me with a crew member and messed up my order. I asked to cancel my order and process a refund, I don't tolerate a guy like this to make fun of girls in front of me. He also suggested me to call to the costumer service number if had any complaint. I am wondering if the operator is aware of this guy? I am not coming back and also will suggest my wife do the same.
Eh. Î¾It's a McDonalds. That being said, food was hot, and customer service was actually far above what I would normally expect here. Î¾It even seems clean.
I agree with Sameer. Î¾Usually Mickey Ds is the same everywhere. Î¾I think this one is a half step below the rest. Î¾I also was annoyed that there is no place to turn in from the opposite side of the street and you have to go down to LBJ and make a U turn to get there.
WORST! MCDONALDS! EVER! Î¾I'm not a huge fan of Mickey D's, but when your driving cross country there's nothing better than a MD's cheeseburger. Î¾There's no crap falling out all over the place; it's one concise package. Î¾That being said, this was awful. Î¾I was hungry late in the day yesterday and thought I'd walk next door to my neighborhood Mickey D's. Î¾Normally I have a hamburger and cheeseburger, no fries no drink, but today I had the Asian salad, with grilled chicken. Î¾The chicken had this slimy goup all over it. Î¾It made the chicken inedible as well as the salad beneath it. Î¾ My friend had a six piece chicken nugget and a fish fillet. Î¾Both were horrible. Î¾My friend is a connoisseur of MD's fish fillet sandwich and he found it intolerable. Î¾The nuggets were devoid of their normal processed flavor which in this case is a bad thing. Î¾Overall, a horrible experience and I'll never go back to this one.
Well, this is one of the few that have not managed to screw up my simple orders and the drive thru moves quickly. But I sweat they always seem to have the mcrib. How is this possible?
This is quite possibly the worst McDonalds around. I walked into the door and was welcomed by a big yellow cone where the lady was cleaning the floor allowing no room to get in the door.As I approached the counter to order, one of the hispanic women started screaming obscenities at the top of her voice at someone in the back, which caused my girlfriend to have to cup her ears due to it being such a loud scream.As I sat down at the table to eat, the lady washing the floors came by our table and hit me in the leg about 6 times with her dirty a$$ mop.I know what I'm getting into rolling into a McD's...but man, this place is bruuuutal!
Doesn't offer Sweet N Low with the coffee, only the blue or yellow stuff that are about as tasty as mixing in dirt. So, today I tried another of their McCafe Vanilla Shakes and, as I reported in a previous review just after the McCafe line was first introduced, it still sucks. If you plan to take this home, by the time you get there it will be a thin, runny, lukewarm gruel with a sensory experience about as appealing as yak cum. Apparently the thick, icy shakes of yesteryear were insufficiently profitable and the accountants elbowed their way into the kitchen. They blew it. Bad. But hey, the fries are still good, that's worth a star.
I am not a big fan of mcdonalds and rarely eat here unless my little makes a special request. The quality of ingredients are subpar and not worth what they are charging. Staff is friendly drive- thru is normally pretty fast so if you like mcdonalds this isn't a bad location
Clean restaurant, fast service. Î¾With that being said, at the end if the day it's still a McDonald's.
We visit this McDonalds about once per week for breakfast. Î¾One week they forgot to put the syrup and butter in our bag but assured me it was at the bottom under the food. Î¾When I arrived home the items were not there. Î¾Yesterday, we went back and I had to ask for the syrup for the pancakes and sugar for my tea. Î¾The food lady said, "If you want condiments, you need to tell the cashier because we do not have time to talk to you. Î¾We are on a time limit to get the cars out of the drive-thru. Î¾If you do not ask for the condiments while giving your order, we will not give them to you." Î¾This is such a sad state that the employees are so rude about their job and employers are so rough on getting customers through like cattle. Î¾By the way McDonalds, when a person orders pancakes, syrup should be provided without asking. Î¾When a person orders a biscuit, butter should be provided without asking. Î¾When a person orders tea of coffee, the order taker should ask if cream/sugar is needed. Î¾I
This McDonald's is poorly ran. They Always cean the bathrooms from 7:30 to 8:15 AM . When they are busy. Today my little girl 41/2 needed to go potty . I told the lady , that spoke very little English that my little had to go potty very bad . She just said sorry . We had to go to subway . I yes you guess right . My little girl did not make it in time :( they can kiss it . We ill not be back and we will tell everybody not to go to this loction
March 23, 2013 my experience at this McDonalds was beyond describing. After waiting at the drive thru and then entering the store only to be told No McFish Bites and No Ice Cream and made to feel like an old man out of place, I was given the phone contact for McDonalds' CUSTOMER SERVICE by the store Manager I was given 1-800-244-6277 DIAL THIS NUMBER. Î¾It is an Asian Sex Phone Line.And this number was given to me by the Hispanic Manager on Duty, Ms Ella Gonzalez. Î¾ I have this piece of paper in a Bank Vault. So if you are in need of having your Big Mac Serviced, then call McDonalds Customer Relations. They will bite your fish.
Food... Although my nuggets were a little over cooked. The service.... I waited 15 minutes ( not exaggerating!) for my dollar burger and an order of nuggets. I will visit a different McDonalds if I feel like having their food while I'm in this area. Chili's gets food to you in 15 minutes... And they aren't considered a fast food restaurant.
If you really need to go to McDonald's, you should try this one. Î¾They don't have WiFi here, but there is a CHANDELIER in the middle of the dining room, which has wood trim everywhere and framed fake paintings on the wall. Î¾It has a very classy feel to the place and I would hang out here, if only my friends wouldn't just refuse the thought.Also, the McCafe drinks are quite good, but they are still quite expensive. Î¾If you want a cheap espresso you should go to the lobby of the Richardson Library. Î¾Cappuccinos, Mochas, etc are just 75 cents a cup.
Well, it's, you know, McDonalds. I've never been inside here, but I've done the drive-thru easily a half dozen times or more over the years. It's not a fancy location, and it's somewhat tedious to get in and out of, but I've never had any food or service complaints. I had one of their new "Cheddar Bacon Onion" burgers the other day, and it was very good, although I'd prefer a slice of cheddar over the Cheez-Wiz kind of stuff that was on it, but that's not the fault of this particular location obviously. Again, no complaints other than non-trivial ingress/egress.
This has to be the slowest McDonald's on earth. 10 minutes to get out 2 happy meals makes me not happy Stay away from this location
Not the cleanest of those owned by the Reiley family- They also own Legacy/ Coit, Parker/Coit and Spring Creek/Independence- I'm sure their are others too- this is probably the least impressive in our area..No playground, small parking lot- everything else is standard McDonald's
Never again will I go to this McD's, or ANY O'Reilly owned McDs if they can't hire quality people! I went through the drive thru and ordered a simple Big Mac, no middle bun, no cheese. Î¾I get home and open my box to find buns, mac sauce, lettuce, and a pickle....no meat, that's right, NO MEAT, none! Î¾I tried calling the number on the receipt only to get a fax machine, which only pissed me off more. I drove BACK to McD's and go inside and ask WTH is wrong with them! Î¾I am laughed at by the KIDS working there, and no one can tell me that they did not make this sandwich like this intentionally b/c of the way I requested it. Î¾And to top it off, this is the 2nd time this has happened! Î¾I threw a fit! Î¾The Mgr took my order again, I told her I wanted HER to make it. Î¾These people aren't worth the minimum wage they're paid, if they're that stupid! Î¾I have a picture and would love to post, but can't see where to do so.
McDonald's is McDonald's. Not much to say when you write a review about it, other than specifics. Here goes.The outside is decorated very nicely. There is a VERY spacious patio area with an HDTV you can watch games on. It is situated directly adjacent to a very large soccer field that is often used. Unfortunately, this means that at night, during games and practices, the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their games.Do not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress. It's probably not very packed at all.Another thing relates to the free wifi. They have the power outlets inside ONLY under a large HD tv where they have 4 comfortable chairs set up. This tells me they only want people using the internet over there and not at the tables, keeping the tables open. From a business perspective, this is smart. From a me being annoyed when I can't use my computer for a long time at a table perspective, this sucked.My air conditioner went out one day and I needed a place to work (I work from home). I went to this McDonald's and had so slump over my laptop all day under a TV blaring ESPN.Also, this place fills up right after the nearby high school lets out in the afternoon and stayed this way for a couple of hours until the parents picked most of the children up. They even have a rent-a-cop during this time who looked like he hated his life.The people working the counter are usually very polite when I go, which is usually at night. I've never used the drive-through.
Ok, so I arrive here with a coupon that says 'order 1 extra value meal and get a like sandwich. Î¾Key word...'like'. Î¾My options for my meal included either 1 big mac or 2 cheeseburgers. Î¾I order 2 cheeseburgers. Î¾Then for my sandwich I request 2 additional cheeseburgers. Î¾The manager tells me 'no, I can only get 1, not 2. Î¾Duhhh...I said "why do u think 'like' is emphasized in the wording"??? Î¾Again she said, I can only get 1 sandwich, not 2. Î¾Fine. Î¾Of course, then I looked for the biggest sandwich I could find....the Bacon Angus Cheeseburger which I think may cost more than the value meal alone and quite frankly probably shouldn't be honored since it wasn't a part of the deal to begin with. Î¾Oh well.....On top of that I'm still callin' corporate to complain.....I'm entitled to my 2 cheeseburgers.
Tried the McCafe Moca today. Î¾Pretty good. Î¾Not sure if I like it more than Starbucks. Î¾It's about a dollar cheaper than Starbucks. Î¾People at this place are ultra friendly. Î¾Had to park to get a mocha which seemed kinda weird. Î¾No big deal. Î¾I wasn't in a hurry.
ALRIGHT so before I start my rant...l was super excited to eat at McDonald's because well, we all crave fast food every once in a while, wouldn't you agree? First off, when did high school kids become so disrespectful?? Mama Kang would have definitely regulated on a few of them. Maybe backhanded a couple others...anyway, I understand when you come to visit a friend at work you get a little chitty chatty. (We all do it) But, when it gets to the point where you are just unaware of the line behind you then a slap to the back of the head is what you deserve. I waited and waited for these kids (who weren't ordering) to move out of the way so I could get my hamburger happy meal with some ice cream. Î¾The employee (their friend) was not even doing anything to get his friends out of the way so that he can assist the hungry people in line. Î¾I waited a total of 15 minutes to even order which has never happened before at a Mcdonald's. Î¾What made the experience even more aggravating was the fact that an older woman with a manager badge was not doing anything to diffuse the situation but instead laughed with the kids. Î¾This isn't coming from a snooty tongue, especially because I'm pretty easily pleased when it comes to food and service but this was a bit over the top. We all know what Mcdonald's taste like so I don't have to go into detail about that...overall, I cured my craving but this experience was something to talk about in a bad way that I haven't done in awhile...Like i said, I'm easily pleased! Also, turn on the dang AC! Or fix it or something! C'mon now, hungry people + heat = raging lions. Step up your game Mcdonald's on Coit and Belt line. Thanks.
They just officially lost my business. The drive through female and male were both extremely rude. The girl took my order and then just disappeared. I asked for my total and then a guy comes through the drive through speaker. I ordered a sausage egg mcmuffin minus the sausage with extra egg. The wanted to charge me for that!!! I work in the food service industry so I have an idea of the food cost. So I'll drive the extra miles and go to jack n the box... Not one more penny is going to the most successful, over payed fast food Î¾franchise Î¾who begs for our money all the time for "charity". Hope the 1 egg and worst customer service was worth losing the business that my friends and family gave you. Fyi.. Jack n the box charges also but they're way nicer and actually make it fresh. Thanks Jack for hiring decent ppl. Could you train Ronald
I work directly across from this place and go for coffee usually - rarely the breakfast. Î¾They ALWAYS get my order wrong - especially through the drive-through. Î¾Be careful for overcharging - and be specific with your order, otherwise they will give you a larger size than what you asked for. Î¾It has happened to us so many times. Î¾And, the manager (during the morning) here sucks. Î¾I told her that they made a mistake to my order and she rolled her eyes as if I did something wrong.
3 stars is about as good a review as a McDonald's can get. Î¾It's McDonald's, what more can you say? Î¾I reviewed this one because their coca-cola had the best syrup to soda ratio I have ever had, it tasted like straight out of the bottle. Î¾Kinda random review, I guess.
I think there is two entries for this location so this is an update of my first review. I have now received the wrong items 2 trips in a row along with ice cold french fries. I ordered the Jalape’±o Chicken Sandwich and received the Spicy Chicken sandwich instead.
Service sucked the workers were gossiping in Spanish near the drive thru window while we waited to be served, took them around 5 minutes to notice we were here, and then messed up our order!
Its McDonald's so we already know the food is decent and slightly over priced. Î¾But the staff here is bad. None of them speak english. They are slow. They will mess your order up so be sure to check it before leaving the drive thru.
Worst mcd's ever. Looks fancy but management obviously doesn't care about service. My sister wanted some fries and a cheeseburger one night after playing some pool at Rack Daddy's so I headed over to this location because it's a block away from home. After paying them $5 for something I'm sure cost them about a nickel I asked if I could have a dipping sauce or two for the fries."No. You have to order a 10 piece nugget or more for sauces. Sorry." ...then closed the drive through door and walked away. Are you fking kidding me? I knew I should have just gone to the Whataburger another block north on Coit, and next time I will.
Poor service. Waited 25 minutes in the drive through with some poor person blasting rap right behind me. Would choose any other fast food place over this location in particular. Do not eat here.
This used to be one of the very best McDonalds anywhere, then the ownership changed apparently to corporate and the location has not been the same since. Service is often hap hazard and the employees , I guarantee, will talk and talk and let you wait at the counter. The interior of this McDonalds is one of those unique ones done up in black and white and while it is beginning to reflect it's age, when the place is clean still looks good. Busy drive through as this is on a Î¾main Plano street.
Very friendly staff. They greeted me right when I walked in the door. I also saw them checking up on people while sipping my coffee. The interior has great decor, and the restaurant is clean. The children's play area is nice and there is plenty of seating for parents nearby. I used their Wi-Fi connection while eating breakfast, and it was very fast. Very pleasant experience. This is a top notch McDonald's and compared to other McDonald's restaurants I'm giving it five stars. I'm looking forward to coming back again soon.
Don't ever go here in the evening between midnight and 3am. The staff are as dumb as rocks, slow, can't understand them when trying to place an order. Oh, and usually between this time it's "Cash only" because for some reason it takes 3 or more hours to batch out their credit card machine. Not to mention the wait time. One time it took over 10 minutes for my sweet tea and fruit & yogurt parfait. Terrible service all around, don't let it's "fancy" interior fool you.
We stopped at this McDonalds because it was on our way to my sisters house. Î¾The food was good, fast as always but I don't know why they took forever to brew up a pot of coffee plus they forgot I had ordered it (probably because the manager and all the employees were chatting and not paying attention to customers). Î¾The indoor play area could use a little cleaning up.
A McD's in a kinda sketchy area. Î¾I've been through the drive thru for breakfast a couple of times. Î¾The only thing to really note is they have two places you can order from in the drive thru. Î¾Don't be an idiot and sit at the first one for too long with out moving to the next one to order, like I did. Î¾Doh. Î¾Otherwise enjoy!
I was just so excited to get to work, call you guys, then make a yelp review. Why? Because you mess something up every single time I go there. Why do I keep going there? Because it is the closest thing to my work in the morning for a quick breakfast. Now, I'll just have to get something closer to my house and eat in the car BECAUSE OF HOW TERRIBLE YALL ARE. You have one job...one SUPER EASY JOB. Take my order, take my money, put my order in the bag and make sure it is correct. When I get to the window and ask "Did you remember the Honey Mustard" nicely. and you give me this smirk of "Heck yes I did", well that is just fantastic, because you guys always forget the sauces I ASK AND PAY FOR. But, this one time you remember. Thats not the part I'm complaining about. I'm complaining because you remembered my Honey Mustard, but forgot my 2 hash browns! I shouldn't have to check my bag at the window when I receive my order. That is just absurd. HOW HARD IS IT TO GET AN ORDER RIGHT WHEN IT IS JUST 2 HASHBROWNS AND HONEY MUSTARD. How much money do they make ezra by saving food and "forgetting" your food even though you pay. Then once we check we are long gone and too far to even turn around and WAIST OUR TIME to get our order right. Pathetic place, you will always stay minimum wage because the simplest of things you can NOT complete. I don't care if it is just a Mcdonalds. It's a business that makes thousands of dollars a day. DO IT RIGHT. If I could give this negative stars I would. I wish I could travel back in time, and build something in the lot of this McDonalds, just so I would know this place would never exist here.
Dirtiest filthiest McDonalds I've ever been to. Î¾Filthy floors in an empty restaurant, filthy credit card machines, dirty rags hanging on the garbage bins. Î¾Will never be back. Î¾Gross gross. Î¾Avoid unless you want a communicable disease or food poisoning. Î¾Ick. Î¾How do they pass their health department check? The jewel on the crown was a salad full of warm wilted lettuce. Î¾Didn't dare eat it.
Do not go in. Walk across the street & get a day old, shriveled up hot dog from Î¾the 7-11. Just take my word for it.
"Would you like any ketchup on your tray?"Huh? Oh, right, you consider this a ghetto location where people will for some reason make off with ALL THE KETCHUP if you give them a chance. So it's hoarded, doled out packet by precious packet. Want a bit more? Better be ready for the glowers as the manager puts one additional packet on your tray. Oh, the sign that screamed "no loitering" was also a very nice touch. "That's not going to be enough?"Nope, I'm going to bathe in it. I'm going to bring it to the homeless downtown and barter with your precious, expensive (Protip: not expensive) packets for a couple of bottlecaps or maybe even a Radaway if I manage to pry 5 of them out of your grasp. When the lights go out, I'm heading here, crowbar in hand, because dammit, I want those ketchup packets.But not their sweet & sour sauce. You want extra of that, you gotta pay.
This one should be bull-dozed down and only a few (maybe some) current employees should be transferred to a different location and the rest...Let Go.Plus, Mr. Bucket (The Homeless Guy with a sign, pan-handling), would have to find another location within Highway 99 other than waiting for drive-thru customers to exit (and his other locations on Highway 99).
I came here 2 days ago just yesterday morning (Sunday) on our family road trip up to Seattle. Î¾Being on a busy driving schedule, we did the drive-thru, but was greatly disappointed at what I got.I think I made a simple order - 2 McChicken sandwiches with no mayo for myself and an Oreo McFlurry for my son, and a cup of water. Î¾I have ordered McChicken sandwiches with no mayo at countless McDonalds for the last 10 years across the US, and they get it right about 95%+ of the time.This time, however, as I started munching on the sandwiches while continuing our drive up I-5, we noticed that BOTH sandwiches not only missed the NO mayo request, but BOTH sandwiches had DOUBLE mayo, both on top and below the chicken patty. Î¾Instead of a NO mayo option, I ended up with a QUADRUPLE mayo-portions for the day. Î¾It was too late to go back and complain and request a correction. Î¾ I was too hungry too, so I just ate them both, but felt my heart clogging up for the rest of the afternoon.My order did show up correct on the order confirmation screen in the Drive-Thru window, and the order did print up correctly on my receipt, but the totally incorrect product turned up in my bag unfortunately. Î¾I'll call the feedback number on the receipt to report the incident so they can hopefully figure out where they went wrong.I believe the rest of their operations is probably good, but I am commenting on my specific incident here, which was my only visit to this McDonald's.
I come here often because it is very close. While the people there are very nice and helpful i have the same issue. Every time i order it is ALWAYS wrong. Î¾ALWAYS. I ordered a chicken wrap plain no cheese crispy. I get lettuce sauce and grilled. I ordered fries and got apple slices. This is just one of many errors they make. I would not come here again or recomend it. This is the only location that gets my order wrong that many times.
The Sherwood McDonalds, for as long as I've lived in the area, is probably one of the worst fast-food places I've been to. Unfortunately, in the interest of convenience and time constraints, we end up running through the drive-thru on rare occasion.Earlier this week they once again met my expectations for being incompetent, apathetic and a waste of money.I ordered a couple meals. 2- 10pc Chicken nugget meals w/ hot mustard and a plain cheeseburger.How many dipping sauces are you supposed to get with the nuggets? 2 per.We got 3 total. 2+2=3 using their new math I guess.1 - plain cheeseburger. I guess at the Sherwood McDonalds that means you REALLY want a plain chicken sandwich because a chicken sandwich is what we received.Fries - COLD, CHEWY, NO SALT and the one medium fry was filled half way - I have a picture I'm attaching.They've installed visual ordering screens in the drive-thru but they've managed to completely defeat that failsafe of the customer confirming what they ordered when the staff can't manage to pay enough attention to what they are putting in the bags.Do yourself a favor. Do NOT go to this place. I never like to see businesses fail but in this case it would be doing the paying community a great service.
Fries are almost always limp and cold here. Ordered a coffee in drive through ( so did car ahead of me) i was told it would be done brewing in a minute and to pull into the waiting spot like the car ahead. Waited 5 minutes and finally car ahead went inside and cones out to tell me they forgot about us. I go inside to get coffee and manager was snarky about the whole situation!
I can't do zero stars so this place gets 1 star. Î¾They nickel and dime you for sauces and add-ons here AND, in spite of the fact that there's a neon sign that says "Drive through open 24 hours" they are only open until 11pm. Really???? 24 hour sign glowing and you close at 11pm?????
We have tried several times to give this location chances. No more chances, bad food, service is slow at drive up. Plus after midnight we have been told no use of credit or debit card's at pick up window not at drive up screen.Cold food Î¾more than once, along with watered down drinks due being poured early with many cars in front of us after we have ordered. Manager could care less, Î¾he ignored us when we asked for him. We drive out of Sherwood to get McDonald's until new management.
I apologize ahead of time to the owners for giving bad publicity to this McDonald's but over the few times I have visited this location, I have not had one good experience. 3 points for the Double K to consider:1. If a customer asks for a refund after waiting over 25 minutes for a 4 piece nugget meal for their kid, your managers should show some sort of logic when dealing with upset people; maybe asking for the reason why a refund is being requested; maybe even go so far as to motivate the employees to not spend the majority of their shift texting on their phones.2. If your staff cannot handle the business from the counter AND the drive through at the same time, maybe NOT such a good idea to ADD another drive through lane; another way to slam the staff with orders they cannot fill within a reasonable time!3. In the process of remodeling any of your locations and there is no regular restaurant seating, a suggestion to accommodate your customers during this temporary situation would be to keep the Play Place seating open until close so customers have a place to eat in.There are many more i could give but here are just a few suggestions from 3 separate visits in hopes the reason for this kind of service is due to you guys not knowing what goes on in this restaurant.
Every few months, I get this sudden urge to make terrible life decisions... like eating at McDonald's or developing a debilitating drug addiction. Î¾This location provided an extra bad breakfast experience, and I probably should have just opted for some crack instead, in retrospect. Î¾Even though I immediately stuffed my hash brown in my face, it was a bit on the lukewarm side. Î¾I'm used to food served at a temperature that can burn off a few layers of skin if you're not careful. Î¾Honestly though, it's McDonald's --- what can you expect? Î¾Two stars because, despite a decent line, I wasn't stuck there for ages.
The service was fine. Î¾ The fish in the fish sandwich looked and tasted like it had been reheated a couple times and burnt a bit Î¾in the process. Î¾Dark brown and dry. Î¾Maybe left over from lunch which was 5 hours before I bought it.The fries were only slightly over done.Does anyone at Mickey's even care anymore as they watch their business crumble?
By far the worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my life. It's filthy, the employees look like drug addicts and criminals and the few times I've went here, I've had the worst Mickey D's food of my life.
They cannot take an order. 5 times and got ill prepared food every time .Writing corporate because the Mcdoubles had the cheese placed wrong. Extra onions..I said none. I said extra pickles..got none. Go here if it's free or you are too drunk to care....ONLY.
On occasion I may exaggerated. Î¾But this place gets my order wrong litterally every single time.. the sad thing is that I dont even like their food, it's just the ONLY place open when I get off, or am going to work. The only saving grace is the drive thru team. Î¾They are constantly sweet and apologetic for their kitchen staffs ineptitudes.
I'd give zero stars or negative if it were possible. This McDonald's threatens to tow anyone who parks in the expansive lot next door. Even when it is almost always vacant. And this reach of jerkiness extends to the alley parking behind over and out. Seriously?! A parking lot that would more than accommodate both your clientele And that of the nearby observatory restaurant? Not cool bro. Not cool at all.
I've been waiting 15 minutes for oatmeal OMG this is crazy I had to walk in and it's still not ready
Despite less than fantastic reviews posted previously, we decided to stop here for a quick take away brekky and got their bacon and egg biscuit with a hash brown. Quick and efficient service, hot freshly cooked food, plus it was delicious! We don't get biscuit brekky in Australia, so it was a real treat for me, and I'm loving American biscuits!!!
Great place to park when you're going to The Observatory or Roscoe's...
Still manages to under impress....Look, we all know McD's, but somehow, someway, this one always seems to be worse than the others. The servers are grumpy, the napkins are always out, no wifi (even though their coffee cups tell me otherwise)... Should I go on? Î¾Yes, because I've only been here for breakfast and there always seems to be a meth-cooker convention. If you can afford something else, go there. If you can't, enjoy a different slice of life.
2 Big Macs for $2 every Thursday. That leaves you with some spare change for that hooker you met at the bus stop on the corner of 82nd and Stark. So it's like three-fer-Thursday!!!24-hour drive through in case you feel like punishing your body in the middle of the night too. That's when the most hookers are hanging around at that bus stop anyway.
Ew. There are plenty of more interesting places to eat.
I did it for you...Okay, we've all been there. This morning I decided to try out this new fangled chicken biscuit for breakfast. Î¾Not sure what all played into that idea. Î¾Maybe it was my craving for McFood after last nights Yelp event at the Dockside. Î¾Maybe it was the commercial right before I pulled into the drive through, whatever. Î¾At any rate, I did it for you. Î¾I tried it so you don't have to. Î¾Turns out, the chicken is different. Î¾Its moist & the batter is appealing to the eye. Î¾But as soon as you get one whiff you know that's some funky chicken. Î¾I think maybe they reached a little too far with this one. Î¾They tried to be too southern or too something and they screwed it up with some herb or flavor that just shouldn't be there. Î¾I think maybe it was dill? Î¾Either way, its all wrong. Î¾Take my word for it, stick to the sausage on that biscuit.
I had just gotten off work and wanted to watch the sunrise about the clouds and mt hood, so I needed something quick. The drive thru was clean and I was the only car around 7am. The first lady was very friendly but the guy that handed me my mcmuffin didn't seem very cheerful. That's about the only problem I had. The mcmuffin tasted very good and was just the correct temperature.My experience only deals with the drive thru. Will update review if I ever go in :)
McDonald's food is usually as it always. Mediocre. But you know that when you go to McDonald's.The thing that just bugs me is that it seems McDonald's (not just this one, but all of them) has a thing against customer service. Not once have I been impressed with service, friendliness or attentiveness. And my standard and expectation for McDonald's are already exceptionally low and I still get disappointed every time.Won't be back here for sure.
Have to agree with others, this is a lousy McDonalds. Terribly slow, only one register open, guy yawning constantly even though only 1:30 pm. But the Food was hot.
I'm a broke college student, so McD's is always an option. Entering the establishment, I was taken back at the cleanliness of the restaurant. There was no line for me to order my food, which is always convenient. Staff were pretty friendly and well groomed. One guy even had a Bible in his hand. The employee that attended me actually had a warm smile on her face; this is unexpected to say the least. Food was hot, and had some flavor of substance. Quality of food however is up to par with Taco Bell and other places that serve recycled dirty diapers. In short, I had an okay experience. I actually felt like I was in a McDonald's commercial. I recommend the "McGangbang." A double cheeseburger and McChicken smothered within two buns.
Day crew is very nice. Night crew is very rude.
This McDonalds is the worst for service, speed and quality of food. Î¾The fries are always cold and the staff could care less about customers.
This place is always slow and it seems like their employees are more interested in texting than working
I have tried this place twice. I hated it both the times. The fried were dry and the chicken sandwich had a really greasy patty and a single dried up lettuce. I couldn't eat it. The second time I tried the food here I got a stomach ache. I am done with this place. Need more food choices inside the terminal not just outside.
Tried the mcdud twice now, what a big mistake. Ordered the Big Mac meal: fries were hard as a rock and tasted 2 days oldAnd the Big Mac had no pickles.Second time ordered the same thing no pickles again even though I made a point of telling the server what happened. And the bun was so stale I thought it was toasted
Yeah, I know. Î¾McDonald's. Î¾If I rated the 500 best burgers I've had, none would be McDonald's. Î¾Sometimes though, convenience rules.If that's the case, this particular McDonald's flat out executes what they are supposed to in fast food. Î¾It's hot, it's fresh, it's clean, and they are quick. Î¾The fries (a particular highlight) are consistently hot, nicely salted and made right.The best fast food in our area is that one particular DQ over on MacArthur Boulevard (I've reviewed that one), but this Mickey D's has a drive-thru and is 24 hours.If you're in a pinch and need a fast food fix, this is the place to go in Central 'Couv.
McDonald's always has good french fries and for prefab strawberry milkshakes they are pretty good. But have they done away with the ingredient, "pink slime" in their hamburgers yet?
It's cheap food. Hit and miss with service. Sketchy as fuck, especially the men's room. So, basically, your typical McMeal experience for an older restaurant that hasn't been updated since the 80s. Oh, and there's the fact that it seems like every time I visit, they're training somebody new. What are the odds, right?
It's McDonald's....enough said.
You eat this food at your own risk!!
I agree with the guy who said eat at your own risk!! Î¾If you don't believe me, Î¾rent a documentary called " Food, inc. Î¾". Î¾I was horrified at what I saw. Î¾I will never eat at a mcdonals, KFC, Wendy's, or other fat food place besides burgerville again.
OK. Î¾So the one thing McDonalds is supposed to be is consistent. Î¾Yesterday, the fries tasted like they had been cooked in very old oil. Î¾That's the only thing McDonalds has going for them is the fries, so this was not what I was looking for.. Î¾Not cool at all. Î¾It took awhile for the aftertaste to go away.
I ordered 2 large coffees one with 4 creams and the other black coffee so I can take to my co-worker but b4 leaving I ask for cream & sugar. The manager looked at me & said "you didn't order any" I asked again & he said I would need ur receipt & I need to add it to the order on my computer. There were people waiting in line so I told him to forget it. I left very disappointed. They count cream & sugar! Oh, during the evening they only take cash. SNAKES!!
Terrible customer service with long waits by incompetent workers. Hire more employees so the wait time isn't so long. Remodel in process. Hopefully they will hire better as well
I go to this restraint, and 3 times i have been ripped off Î¾1 I ordered 2 large size #3 I pay at window 1 and at window 2 they hand me 1 bag w/2 burgers and 2 large cokes and rudely shut the window on me, when they finely re open the window they tell me What, I say ed I'm missing my Fry's there reply was i did not order Fry's, so after fighting to get what i payed for they shut the window on me and yell at what they says was the manager and re open the window and hand me 2 small fays, and they replied here manager says you can have small Fry's, on a nother note i place my order and pay get home and find out my order is completely wrong ill be missing items and what should be large is occurs small people are rude and unprofessional
Recently renovated, typically clean.Employees are friendly enough. Î¾While not jumping at the chance to go the extra mile in kindness, no one has ever been outwardly disrespectful.The food is typical of McDonalds standard. Î¾And like almost any other resturant some days the food might be more chilled or not as fresh.All in all I am okay with eating here when I choose fast food.That being said, I would like to see an improvement in staff cleanliness. Î¾For instance-after you sneeze in your hands, please do not pick up a cup and hand it to me. Î¾ Same goes for running your hands through our hair, coughing, ect.Wash up! before continuing service! Î¾But these incidents are case by case preformed by the individual not specifically the restaurant. Î¾And this is something that I feel no matter where I go. Î¾Cleanliness is next to godliness. Î¾Also, just point blank a good practice.
Pretty bad, even by fast food standards. I've been there twice, and the first time the drive thru guy cut me off right when I was beginning an order and then took the orders of three people in another lane before I finally pushed in and made my order through the drive in window. I got my order, it was cold, and not the right sandwich.Second time I went, my iced tea was warm, with no ice, and tasted like corn syrup. Undrinkable. The mcflurry I ordered was half full, and it looked as though someone had taken a few bites out of it already. Didn't eat it for fear that someone had already used the spoon.C'mon, McDonald's. I know this is fast food, but it doesn't have to be completely incompetent.
Not very clean, food handlers not using gloves, Î¾one was even wearing her purse while cooking burgers.Really?
Forgot half my order, then made me wait 10 mins to correct it. Not very fast food.
Rude! Rude! Rude! Î¾Many of the people who work here are pleasant, but the management of this restaurant is just rude. Î¾My car was damaged by one of the cashiers opening the drive thru window without looking and the manager repeatedly tried to accuse me of driving too close. Î¾I have been a Micky D's manager before and what you are supposed to so is 1) apologize, 2) get information from the customer, 3) forward to your insurance carrier and 4) apologize again. Î¾None of this happened until I called the district manager. Î¾This McDonalds or any others in the franchise will never see my business again.
Your typical mcds.They will mess up your order There's Î¾a real dollar menuGet the buffalo ranch mchicken mmmmm
I got the premium chicken sandwiches. For five dollars each. The size was anything but premium. The buns were small to begin with but the meat was 30% smaller than the bun. Î¾I guess I'll be getting my premium sandwiches somewhere else from now on. The taste and texture was very good and the service was not bad either. If you want to eat a good burger go to Five Guys. Five Guys tastes better and you get a bigger bang for your buck. You need to step up your game McDonald's, otherwise Five Guys is going to be on every corner which I don't mind.
Dishonest employees. They are currently running their Monopoly game at all the McDonalds. I ordered a 20 piece McNugget which comes with 4 game pieces. I got two 10 pieces nugget boxes, which gets me to my 20, so all is fine... *But* what an employee did is they took off the Monopoly game pieces on 1 of the nugget boxes and stacked that one in the bag first so it was on the bottom of the bag and not visible. They stacked the untouched box on top of it so I couldn't tell that the bottom one was missing the game pieces. I called Martha who manages the place to let her know what's going on, she offered me the two game pieces if I wanted to come back and get them, which I refused, because I do not want to drive there again and could care less about the game. I just wanted to let people know in case this also happens. Just real petty stuff, but thought I would share.
Eww... My lil bro loves it here, so my family will take him once and a while. I never eat here. I don't know where their food comes from, so I don't know how healthy the food is. I gave up fast food when I was in 10th grade cause it was making me sick. McDonalds has always been nasty, and I can't see how people can eat this stuff! It ain't that good for people, stop eating it!! Thank you
I'm not a fan of fast food health risks but I still eat the occasional burger when I am in a hurry. This McDonald's is always fast and reliable and for that I say, "Thank you McDonalds!"
At first, this McDonald's location was an angel because even though breakfast was over, they had some leftover and were able to fulfill our orders.But, that was it.The cashier who was the manger was oh so....unfriendly. Î¾Not even a smile. Î¾It was like "what do you want?" Î¾It wasn't just with me and my party but towards other customers. Î¾Like gee, did you get up from the wrong side of the bed or what?Then, my fiance dumped his sweet tea as it was bitter.A friend of mine dumped his coffee as it was horrible.Friendly service and fresh beverage would have definitely saved this place.
Not the best McDonald's I've ever been to. Î¾The chicken nuggets arrived a bit cold and it just wasn't the same. Î¾I rarely eat McDonald's, but when I do I am really craving a few chicken nuggets and crispy french fries. Î¾If you can't do that right, I'll skip it all together and find a different place in the mall to placate my salty, greasy needs.
Doing brisk business. "Food" ready in less than 10 seconds. Unpalatable, Î¾but my child got an LPS toy, which she was very happy about and exactly three apple slices, which she and baby sister fought for while eschewing the nuggets and fries. Good girls!
EVERY TIME I go to this McDonald's, I swear the line cook must be a smoker with no taste buds. No matter what sandwich I get it's WAY over salted. They seriously ruin the food every time I visit, which is daily, as I work in the mall. They have decent customer service, some are more polite and knowledgeable. However, I don't think the others have business holding a customer service job.
I mostly do not go to McDonald's....then realized that when I do? Î¾I always go here. Î¾Maybe it is the "only game in town" over this way.....but, in any event they have always been awesome. Î¾24 hour drive through, in and out and on the road again (Hwy 30). Î¾I only use the drive through so I can't comment on the lobby.
I rarely go to McDonalds but one day I was thinking about the chocolate dipped ice cream comes I used to get as a kid and I decided to stop by and get one. Not only did they not have them but when I compared their menu to the corporate menu, I realized they don't have many of the items that are supposed to be part of the standard menu.
This is the only McDonald's near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into DT Portland or go across the bridge. Tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but I just can't do it anymore. And here's why.One, look at the storefront photo. I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don't get why they can't read instructions properly or anything. Why can't the condiment be separate and not default? It's so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they "got it right" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said "F it" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I didn't go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn't a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn't have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can't do their job. I don't even get much time to eat lunch so I didn't have time to go back and complain. I'm done with this location any way so if I'm craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I'll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn't crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that's it.)Conclusion: If you crave McDonalds, don 't go to this location unless you want dead flies in Î¾your burgers/sandwiches or missing Chicken McNuggets.
Stopped in the Drive Thru at this location for a McDouble at around 9:30pm. I asked for it to be made without salt on the meat. When I get to the window, the lady said rather rudely that they could not make it that way because...get this...they had already cooked all the meat for the night and the grill was closed down.I said, "So if I drive up and order a burger at 4am, you're telling me that you're going to serve me meat that was cooked 8 hours ago?" She said, "Yeah, well that's the way all McDonald's operate."Disgusting. I know McDonald's isn't exactly known for the highest standards, but serving burgers made "fresh to order" with 8-hour-old cooked meat is just downright NASTY.
I'm a Sucker for an Egg McMuffin
This is fast-food. I rolled through the drive thru a little after 8 in the evening there were a few cars in front of me and I waited all of one minute at the window. Î¾ I ordered the supreme Quarter Pounder with Cheese the largest fry and two apple pies it cost me just a little teeny more than eight buck. Î¾ Service was friendly helpful and reasonably quick. Î¾ Honestly, everything was good quality in fresh the quarter pounder supreme was very filling and tasty and the fries I honestly couldn't finish. Î¾ The only reason I haven't given this MacDonalds a 5 star is because, well it is fast food, and it's not like they're making gourmet $10 burgers. I got what I paid for and what I expected and was pleased I would be happy to go back if I was in the mood for this style of fast food.

This McDonalds ruined my lifeBy Anthony GamezThis McDonalds ruined my life by existing. The end
Had to go here a few times, when I'm pulling 10 hours a day at work! Î¾Yeah, yeah it's McD food (Not sure what Zax is talking about, it's not more expensive here!!!) The service is always GREAT, they are not cheap on giving you more ketchup, salsa, and other packages (some other cities around here charge extra), clean restrooms, CLEAN FLOOR & the parking lot is always amazingly neat (unlike other McDs)....
I would safely guess that this is a franchise and if the owner reads reviews, you need to re train or fire your current staff. We NEVER eat fast food for a variety of reasons. The off chance we stopped by and the ONLY time, the order was unacceptable. We asked for "freshly" made items and instead got the leftovers of stale food. We asked specifically for certain items to be left off the meal, to which our request was ignored. We paid over $10 for a meal that no one ate. While attempting to give your location employee feed back, they couldn't be bothered. Clearly my phone call was interfering with their priorities, and their lack of concern only impacts your bottom line. We would NEVER go back.Edited to ADD: When you are told to wait so they can "COOK" your food to make sure it's newly made and fresh, they should be able to stand by their word. I was LIED to, and while i waited an additional few moments, clearly my meal was not freshly made. It was STALE and OLD. I realize this is fast food, but the one time I go and request to have food made specifically so I can eat it, they ignore my request, lie to me, and then proceed to charge me for food that wasn't edible. Thank goodness I am a healthy eater, lesson learned.
Ordered the silver meal and asked for the nuggets and the French fries to be cooked fresh, as they took the 3 minutes to get my order together they giver my food and I have cold fries and even colder nuggets. My wife takes on fry back because the kids are hungry and okay with any French fry and I take the nuggets back and they have a nerve to tell me they are fresh after I have that discussion I tell the lady you need to out my fries also the manager tells her they are fresh and guess what not fresh again overall not so great moment at Î¾McDonalds
More expensive than other MCD's in the area. Same food, less value.
It's MacDonald's. Î¾What do you expect?
Better McD's than most others. New manager made a difference. Plenty of friendly workers and food comes out hot and reasonably okay. No more cold fries and old tasting burgers.
It's a McDonald's. What can I say?The drive-thru hasn't been updated so it's still a single lane. But it is one of the quicker drive-thrus in the area. I might have given them three stars except the last time there I was ordering food for 7 people. When we got back to the house, we realized they didn't give us everything ordered and had not gotten the drink order right. Oh well...some days ya just can't have it all.
Just went through the drive thru. Ordered coffee and the two medium fries for $3. Was told to pull up to wait for the fries. After 8 minutes I went inside. Two more minutes they said. I told them to keep the three bucks and left. 10 minutes for fries! Really? And we are supposed to pay these people $10 an hour to make us wait? Really?I'm done with McDonalds. I may not spend much at fast food places, but not one more dollar is going to them.
Ok, so I'm not a McDonalds guy. When it comes to fast food food, I think Wendy's beats just about everything else out there with a drive thru. However, I've got to give it to this (and most) McDonalds for having clean bathrooms. Î¾I'm not really into doing my business away from home, but let's face it, sometimes you just don't want (or can't) wait. When this is the case, having a handy Golden Arch(es) is much appreciated. Thanks for the facilities Ronald!
It was gross, I choked down the burger. I didn't like the fries either, the girl was cute though. The place was filled with old timers nursing cups of coffee and throwing hard looks around. I found myself wondering why this place is so popular. It was about $4 bucks I guess you don't get much for $4 dollars anymore.
What am I supposed to say it's a McDonald's. I'm not expecting much. Just get the order right and put my food in the bag is quick as you can. It's so simple but yet you mess up almost every time. That must be why everybody has such a poor attitude who works there. They are so defensive from being yelled that all day long from screwing up. You would think that would be humbling and you would be apologetic to your customers but instead you choose the road of confrontation. What do you expect from somebody who qualifies for the same job as somebody who has murdered 30 people, just got out of prison, and dropped out of school in the third grade. By the way this unhappy interaction was with the store manager! Î¾Probably gets beat it home so when she comes to work it's her time to have a power trip and act like she wears the pants for once in her life. Thanks for the wonderful dining experience.
Rude employees for sure. Î¾Even the manager guy was rude.They have two lines and three windows. Î¾After ordering from one of the two menus/speakers, there's a sharp turn, and that's where the first window is. Î¾I had stopped at that window (since there was a car in front of me anyway), and no one was there. Î¾Since no one was standing there, and the car in front of me had moved forward, I moved forward as well.I looked into the second window, and no one was there either, but it was blocked off/had a sign to go to the next window. Î¾I waited for the car in front of me to move, while still looking back at that first window because I was 90% sure the girl that took my order said to go to the next window. Î¾Still no sign of anyone.I pulled up to the last window and the girl filling cups didn't acknowledge us. Î¾Finally, she opened the window and told another girl to take our debit card. Î¾That girl, probably the youngest out of everyone I could see in the back, was friendly and took our debit card without glaring at us like the rest of the employees. Î¾But she took our card somewhere else.Then the manager man came back with our card and pretty much threw it at me without saying anything. Î¾The other girl that hadn't acknowledged us, but opened the window originally handed us our food and our drinks.I'm pretty sure they were being rude to us because we hadn't paid at the other window, but I'm pretty sure it's not the CUSTOMER'S fault that the EMPLOYEE at the register WAS NOT AT THE REGISTER.Good thing about franchises, especially McDonald's is that you can go to a different one. Î¾If the staff isn't quite as rude as this one, even if they're still rude, I'd much rather go anywhere else. Î¾So sorry YOU made a mistake, but don't take it out on us. Î¾You're just giving a whole brand a bad name, no big.
You're typical McDeez chain game.I haven't been inside, just usually going through the drive-thru. Fast service and helpful. Lovin' the chicken nuggets, fish fillet, chicken sandwich, anything on the $1 or if you want to be creative - the McGangBang! (McChicken sandwich in a Double Cheeseburger = delicious grease!)Everyone knows that this stuff is bad for you, but if you're pinched for time and need something quick. Or you're just stressed out and need some artery cloggin' lovin' this is a go to place. Finals coming up? How about a Big Mac or 20 pieces of chicken nuggets? Some sweet tea? Nothing's better than having a little bit of McDeez in your life. It's everywhere you go and better yet, they got a Red Box outside for you to rent some movies. If you're craving some unhealthy goodness, go to McDeez and get your fix!
Asked for sausage egg mcmuffin. Paid for sausage on a muffin. Received biscuit with only egg and cheese. Biggest waste of time. If you can't execute, don't attempt.
McDonald's not where you would think to go for fish balls? Stay with that thinking. The best part of the meal was the fries, naturally. Second came the whole origami thing building the little platform for the tarter sauce cup. I could not find anything fun to do with my fish balls after eating three of them to confirm that this was a very, very bad idea. Not nasty tasting, depending on your view of McDonald fish sandwich, I like 'em. With all of the parts together, not deconstructed in this manner. There is cheaper food products to throw if you want to start a food fight in one of their restaurants.The fish balls are incommodious.Or, simply stated: yak.
I was there this past Sunday and I experienced terrible customer service. The dinning room was also filthy. There were no napkins and the ketchup area was a mess. Î¾While I was ordering in the dinning room, there was a girl who worked there was on her break, chatting (non-work related) with her co-worker behind the register. Î¾After I finished my food, I wanted to buy an McFlurry (no one was there to assist). After standing there for a couple of minutes, the girls said to another worker, " you have a guest". The girl didn't do anything and turned away. Another gentleman who was working there, came up to me and took my order. I don't dine at McDonald's often, but I can say that I will never go back to this location again.
Was so hungry! Didn't had a car and when I requested and wanted to place an order from the drive through window! He says rudely that we can take your order and closes the window on my face! Though I like Mc Donald's but this place is weird!
Sorry but this location was not a good experience. The staff was rude and the food was not done as we asked so when we took it back they wanted to argue with my husband.
Well its McDonalds. You've been there before, you know what to expect. Some notable differences for this location:God help if you if you don't like cheese. Because they will give it to you whether you want it or not. It was funny the first time I ordered a McDouble with no cheese and got a burger with a sticker that said NO CHEESE on it that did indeed have cheese. Not so much the next dozen times it happened.There is a homeless woman who is always standing outside of it. Its always the same homeless woman and shes been there for at least the last three years that I've worked in the area. Not really related to McDonalds but thought it was worth mentioning.I think she really likes McDonalds.
If they are willing sometimes yes or no. But to make a $1value Mcdouble or Double cheese burger into a Big Mac. Add shredded lettuce, grilled onions and a side of Big Mac sauce will = to a non sesame bun - 1 carb in the middle (extra bun) = $1 Big Mac or some will charge for the Mac sauce but it will still be cheaper.Order Chicken nuggets, fish fillet, chicken sandwich "fresh I'll wait" it tastes so much better and different than the ones they have pre-made in the warmer.
This Mcdonalds is locathttp://media4.ct.yelpcdn.com/static/201012168Î_89169237/i/ico/star_big_5.gifed a few blocks from Intel. A block from the Hillsboro airport and in the same parking lot as Costco. Its Hillsboro's newest Mcdonalds, opened in 2002. Service is pretty much the same as any Mcdonalds but a bit better then at other locations in the area. Food quality is pretty much the same as any Mcdonalds but they seem to keep on top of the freshness. I have experienced no problems with "custom orders" and they seem happy to do them. Lots of seating. Wide open dining room. Free wi-fi. Dual drive though lanes makes it easy to get though the drive though faster. No play structure though so if you come here so your kids can play you are out of luck.This store has new management, but I have notice no major changes since they took over a few weeks back.The only negative thing I have is they don't wear gloves when making the food. Very unsanitary.
I usually go through drive thru here and 95% of the time when they hand me my food and say have a nice day there is something missing in the bag. Then when you stay at the window they look at you in disgust as if you don't believe they made your order correctly. Well, there is good reason for that. In addition to the incorrect order, if you order a large fry you can expect about as many fries as come in a small size. Always feel ripped off. I paid for a large not a small in a large container. Not to mention there is a homeless camp a few feet from the drive thru. Pretty trashy.
Best McDonald's drive-through service they're open 24 hours they usually always get your order correct.Cheap prices extensive menu, employees are nice what more can I say
I don't go to McDonald's looking for anything great. I mean, it's McDonald's... howevee I am very picky about condiments so I always order my burgers plain. This McDonald's is so ridiculous. They mess up my order every time. One time they gave me coffee with creamer and sugar when I ordered black, they actually put more effort into messing up my order than making it correctly. Another time they put my fries in my bag upside down. They forgot two burgers and a large fry one time when I was picking up supper on my way home. They almost always fail to make my burger plain even though the receipt clearly says plain. They remake your food if they messed up but they aren't nice about it and they never offer you anything like a coupon or something free to make up for their mistake. And they're coffee in the morning is always burnt. It's terrible! The only thing they do right is the frappes and I've only ever ordered one!
My wife and I were at the McDonalds on 12109 NE Glisan St Portland OR 97220 today (May 1, 2011) at 1:11pm. We got a cheddar onion mcchicken and a medium fry and medium drink. The food was cold when we got it, the fries on top were warm but the rest were ice cold and hard as rocks. The burger was ice cold and I asked for another one, the girl took it back and returned a burger to me within 30 seconds. She did not wash her hands at all. There was a clump of hair in it. There were no hairnets on any employee. I spoke with the "manager" Sean, and Sean decided to leave before I was done with my statement because I Î¾asked the manager if not having hairnets, having facial piercings and taking a cup back after a customer has handled it and putting it back in the cup dispenser was a common practice at McDonalds, Sean told me "Go ahead, call the fucking health department asshole I don't care!" My wife Î¾and I have had upset stomachs since we got home (we were only there 20 minutes and live 15 minutes away)
Dirty smelly bathrooms and no changing table! A real shame! My kids love McDs! We won't be back to this one though
Went through the drive-thru and had no issues. Î¾The outside is very pretty and nice looking. Î¾The only downside to this McDonald's I had was the entrance and exit which is very confusing if you don't know how to get there. Î¾It's one of those locations where you can see where you want to go but the city through one way's and islands prevents you from reaching it. Î¾You have to go around the block and come in from behind it on a small side street with no sign indicating you need to turn there to get to it.
So, from the exterior, this McDonald's is fantabulous. I guess it was a remodel, because everything else in the area seemed new. I went through the drive through because it was raining (no, I was just really lazy), and the gentleman from the box was really unfriendly. I like my Dollar Menu with a smile. So, no thank you, I am not the Terminator, and I won't be back.
This is one of the worst rudest McDonalds I have seen. Went through the drive thru at 6:12AM on Friday May 2nd. When I pulled up I received the most unfriendly greeting ever. Not a "good morning" or a "how are you" or "what can I get you?" or anything like that. Seriously just a "hello" is the most monotone voice ever. The lady needs to drink some coffee or something. Then once I ordered she said, "that's it?" and that was that. Yikes! Then when I pulled to the second window for the food, the guy hands me the bag and I said thank you and he closed the window. Not a "thank you" or even a single word out of his mouth! And there was no one behind me so it's not like he was busy. I mean, I know it's just drive thru but that doesn't mean you can't be polite and offer friendly service.
It's still just a McDonald's despite the fancy remodel. It looks beautiful but tastes the same. That said, sometimes all that will do is a gut burger from MickyD's, so it fits the bill. Free wifi and a good view of accident corner.
how do you screw up ice-cream? Come here for an education!
I am a big fan of Mc Donalds, however the young ladies at the registers are unprofessional, and untrained. The promotion for buy one Quater pounder get one free after doing a review is lost upon the entire staff. This was on a monday, but happened again on a tuesday. I am telling everyone i know, and i have a LARGE Twitter follower, also as a HUGE facebook following.
On my way to the local brewery not too far from here we decided to grab a bite to eat beforehand. Î¾We pulled into the drive through because getting out just seemed like an unnecessary risk. Î¾As we waited and finally got up to the menu, the order taker informed us that they were only accepting cash at the moment. Î¾My driver decided to exit the line but I insisted on getting him a meal. Î¾I risked life and limb to get that man dinner. Î¾I agree with the other reviewers that this place is less that satisfactory. Î¾The cashier was not even the slightest bit delightful in my ordering experience. Î¾The restaurant did not look very clean. Î¾The employees were arguing about something very loudly that made me a bit uncomfortable. Î¾Anyway, I got the food and got out of there ASAP! Î¾I will not be back unless it is the last place on earth to get food.
I swear the service with this mcdonalds is NO GOOD AT ALL!!! I don't like stopping at this McDonald's location cause I absolutely hate theirService but my girlfriend was hungry after work and she insisted weStop there so she can get a bite to eat so I went for it! BIG MISTAKE!! 1ST of all Once they speak it seems like they have an attitude. they dont even greetYou with good customer service and huff and puff as if they are in a rush to take your Order. 2nd when I ordered the wings for my girlfriend they said "its gonna be A 20 minute wait after you pay" are they serious they cant start on my orderRight away once I place it??!! There was 3 cars in front of me so I have to waitEven longer??? So I said no thank you we will just order something else and thereWe hear another deep breathe as if im taking very long to place my order. Then after I placed my order we stood in line with 3 cars still in front of us so we waited patiently.After waiting 15mins and no car has moved and 2 cars behind us left the line we decided to go to the McDonald's on cicero and 28th where they have great customer service, everything on the menu available and we dont have to wait 20-40Minutes for our food...the McDonald's on 3200 w Roosevelt is the worse place anyone can go to for food.. Before I left today the cashier at the window looked my way and of course I stopped and told her the I was going to write a review on yelp and she laughed and said "yeah okay boo do you" unbelievable I dont understand how these people still have their job!!! Please tell me which McDonald's allows their employees to play loud music while at work? This place was very very ghetto and I seriously dont recommend for anyone to stop at this location!!! I rather starve then to eat any food from this place!!! I really hope they bring in new employees that have good customer service, speak proper english, know how to clean and dont dress up so ghetto!!!
Quite possibly the worst McDonalds on the planet. Absolutely vile and disgusting, food and service alike.
horrible.... that is all. Do not go there.
I stopped at this location with my boyfriend earlier this evening to grab a bite to eat after stopping off to pick up some things for his apartment and this was one of the most ghetto McD's I've been to. I've seen some pretty bad places, but this place took the cake in terms of filth and vagrancy because the place seemed to be a location for people to loiter around in and having people up in there begging for change and all while you're trying to order your food. I was waiting with my fiance for his food to come up and the guy behind the counter was banging his hand saying "can I help the next customer".....really you think you can get someone's attention banging your hand on the counter like some ignorant fool with no professional standards. Who would want to eat in this place with folks standing outside trying to sell you stuff and this one guy was begging for change to allegedly feed his baby sister.....that's so typical for them to sit there and lie because they want someone to give them money so they can feed their whatever habit they're trying to hide. This restaurant is situated in one of the most ghetto neighborhoods on the west side which says how the standards has gone down. If they really cared they would keep the restaurant clean inside and outside and I was glad that I didn't see the inside of the bathroom because if it's a ghetto McDonalds the bathrooms wouldnt exactly look like they were maintained well either. I wouldnt bother eating here unless you want to be harassed by goofy hoodrats and crack fiends looking for someone to give them change. I can think of at least 10 McDonalds locations that has staff that don't look like they were plucked from the ghetto garden because this McDonalds seems to employ hoodrats and ghetto snots to work at this particular location. I have gotten much better service elsewhere than this place I won't be coming here again and I want to be served by someone who can properly wear a hairnet that's not the length of the hairstyle and doesnt look like a hoodrat with multi colored dragon lady tips a mile long.
Filthy and putrid smelling restroom, everything from crumbs to spilled coffee on the tables, floor looks like it hasn't been swept our mopped in a week. I just wanted to get my cheat meal in, between work appointments and the food took unreasonably long, the communication was such, that I wondered if most people were in training and the only girl that seemed to know how to sail the ship walked outside to smoke a cigarette. This franchisee should sell the location to someone that can run it.
When I used to work in Hillside, this McDonalds would sometimes work as a stopgap measure for an early morning breakfast if I left the house without one. Yes, yes, it is unhealthy, but sometimes you just want that extra wink of sleep or two!Over the year and a half span of working in this area, I hit the drive-thru up perhaps a dozen times. Out of those twelve visits, about half of them had issues with my order.Here are the issues I can remember:* Smaller sized smoothie than I paid for* Not including ketchup when requested* Not including hot sauce when requested* Not including napkins when requested (yes, people eat out of their cars!)* Giving me someone else's orderThose are just the issues I remembered, but there were probably others. I never actually went inside to complain, as these pit stops were right before I had to open my business in the morning. With a 50-50 chance of getting your order right, that just seems poor listening skills. I hope the management takes note of this.If you do want a better sit-down breakfast or lunch, try the JK's restaurant about two blocks east on Wolf and Saint Charles. You'll get much better service here, providing you have the time to sit down and enjoy it.
The last 3 times that I've come here have been a long wait and people who come after myself are served first in the drive thru, every time. It's mainly the drive thru where this business is missing it.... But that's what I use most when it comes to McDonald's at least. I am not used to a McDonald's ever being dysfunctional. This one is a double drive thru... I left twice now without an order taken because I was waiting in the drive thru for someone to take my order but they took other cars orders first who were not even there when I first got there. The first time I let it slip because I knew they just opened. The second time I left. But the third I'm leaving too...
Worst mcdonalds around. Fills the fries half way. They have to be taught that because I have complained numerous times and the managers always say they are sorry and will talk to the employees. I can't wait until my kids out grow this place. From now on if I go back I will request fries that are filled to the top and then check my bag before I pull away.
I do not normally go to McDonalds but I saw a line of cars in the drive through and thought this place must be excellent to have so many clamoring for their food. Upon entering this establishment I came upstairs n their varied many and perused the items hoping upon hope that they had Foie gras as I had a taste for the liver of a goose. It was not to be found. They must be animal rights activists that run this establishment. I asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality was and she told me the Big Mac was one of their finer dishes. I placed the order along with some French fries, I no longer call them freedom fries now that the French have come fully on board with our war against Muslim countries #jesuischarlie I wonder how these French fries will be served, I am imagining they will be garnished with black truffles . I ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one. How peculiar for a restaurant that serves French food. To my horror no baguettes either. My food bill comes to 6.30 cents. Imagine that, the Big Mac meal , their finest offering and it is only just over 6 dollars. The wait is not long for my entree, so glad I did not ask for their freedom onion soup. Strangely the food is in a box and a carton. This must be a new style , the creativity of chefs these days knows no bounds. I am impressed. I open up the box and there lies this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it. It is cold and damp. This must be an artistic statement of some kind. Possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the Intuit natives at the turn of the last century. I am impressed by the chefs social concerns but I had wished that the food was hot. I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet as I made a run for it. They must have been upset that I ordered the foie gras originally. They are making me pay for it. I know when I have been defeated. My pomme frites were hot but lacking any French accoutrements. This must be French cooking under the Vichy government when the Germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausages. Completely defeated I made my way to the exit sign as I heard a cackle of teenage girls laughing at me as I tripped over the yellow wet floor alert signal. This is the last time I will ever eat in a French restaurant again. Perhaps I should have ordered the escargot.
How does this qualify as a restaurant? Î¾Dear yelp, please take McDonalds off of the restaurant heading and place into the bad life choices category.
If there was an option for a negative rating, that's what this place would get. Not only worst mcdonalds experience, but worst fast food experience I've ever had. At this point been in the drive thru line 23 mins & after taking my order & credit card told it'd be another 5-10 mins. Cars behind me gave their orders when I was told to go to the window to give mine because the registers weren't working. Person behind me drove right off with their order while I'm waiting for an order for one. Was not even told my total at the window. Doesn't have friendly workers working the drive thru. This new mcdonalds needs to get some advice from other locations on how to run a business & hire new staff.
I've had no problems with the service, my problem is the shady characters that hang around. The hate for this place is probably because of that. I'm gonna give it 3 stars because of the service I've received especially from the manager himself, but some of the people who come in to sell stuff and hang around yelling to one another are more than annoying.
By far the worst McDonalds I have ever been to. Since I live close by I wanted to give them a chance but no more. The service is extremely slow and the last time we went, my son had hairs on his burger. Disgusting. Do not go here. You will only regret it.
The reason I gave this McDonald's 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the young lady that was behind the counter.She had great customer service skills and although there were a lot of people in line she seemed to have a system and got the line down pretty quickly!I was also charged 2.99 for a sausage egg McMuffin that was listed at 2.79 and I was given my difference back even though they said the sandwich was suppose to be 2.99.I would have went back to that McDonald's if I wasn't at a volunteering event for seniors that day so I had no choice but to choke down my hard crisp eggs, burnt muffin and dried out sausage.I don't understand where Quality Control is going for many of these fast food restaurants, its like because we have a value menu or a dollar menu we don't have to serve food that is fresh and hot!Even if I was in the area unless I was just getting a coffee I wouldn't go back to this McDonald's!Just so sad!
I ordered the Premium Crispy Chicken Club Sandwich however, when I arrived home to eat my meal it was not the Premium Crispy Chicken Club Sandwich. There was no bacon or cheese , they put way to much mayo on the sandwich. The sandwich did not look eatable, it actually looked disgusting. Î¾The fries were cold and thrown in the bag. I'm shocked they would send something of the sort out to a customer. Î¾I usually do not eat fast food however I will not be visiting this location ever again.
This Mcdonald I rarely go to. Food is dry, service is slow. I got the oatmeal and sausage buscuit and they both were not good and dry Î¾This the type of place you forget to ask for jelly, butter or ketup because you're trying to hurry and get out of there. Its too crowded too many people hang in there like peddlers, drunks and crack heads. Dont ever lose anything like a wallet or phone bc its long gone in a matter of seconds.
Was solicited by panhandler four times while waiting to pay cashier for food after placing order. Person stood uncomfortably close when I pulled out money to pay for meal. Cashier observed this happening and said nothing, nor did the manager. I watched this person ask everyone in line for money. Was also solicited as I entered the restaurant - also from inside the restaurant. The clerk did not get the order correct - required a revisit to the line. The crew seemed indifferent and very untrained. The place was also not very clean. McDonald's corporate should investigate this place - it gives McDonald's a bad name. I would avoid this McDonalds.
I've read the reviews, so I know that this place has been less than popular over the years. However, I think they've made some improvements. I've never been inside, but the drive-thru is always quick and accurate. The service has been friendly and attentive on all of my visits as well.
Good coffee.TERRIBLE AWFUL, RUDE STAFF.I was given a roll of pennies as change because the girl was too busy visiting with her friends to try to get other coins in exchange for my dollar bill.
This McDonald's is improving because they changed management and how they have people who actually work. It's a shame they had to get a Hispanic crew to change this place!!!!!
This McDonald's is one of the most disgusting I've ever been to. I don't know why I keep going back through the drive-thru (I guess deep down I want it to get better), but I keep getting disappointed. I got a McRib a few days ago and that made my decision to never return to this location. The bread tasted old and the meat had a vile aftertaste. Dis-gus-ting!!!!
This place is a mess! If I could give it zero stars I would. Every time I go in there I have to wait in line - morning, mid-day, lunch, night....doesn't matter. The floors are always filthy and there usually is a weird and funky smell. However, its close to work, and sometimes I get desperate. Two weeks ago I went through the drive through with a co-worker for iced coffees. We ordered and paid and when we pulled up to the last window we were informed there was no ice. At that point they also did not understand why we did not want our coffees.A week later I waited in line forever for an icecream. Only to be told they have no shakes or icecream.I am not even a big McDonalds person, but I would think ice, shakes and icecream would be things they could manage to not screw up. Guess not.
Worst service ever avoid this place.
Worst mcdonalds ever! My boyfriend and I went through the drive through and ordered our food. We were told to pull up past the window to wait for our order. School was letting out so there was teens walking through the parking lot and about to fight right next to my car! Finally after about 10 minutes my boyfriend gets out the car pissed and goes inside only to notice that the doors was locked. Finally the security comes to the door with our order. Horrible!
It really needs ZERO stars! Terrible customer service! Terrible Cooks! And Ghetto ass Managers! Need I Say more?!
I hate this McDonald's. Î¾It's always sooooooo crowded, the drive-thru is a mess, and they always fill the glass 3/4 full, with no ice! Î¾it also feels like the prices are higher than other Mickey D's. Î¾I dunno...maybe not?I only stop here when in a pinch after a ball game when I'm starving, and tired of ball park food.
This McDonalds' gets 3 stars for being open all night. Sometimes i just have a craving for chicknuggets or I just need to grab some double cheeseburgers at 3am and Maxwell St Depot Polish isn't what I'm craving. So Kudos for being the closest open 24 hour McDs to me.However, if you do come, take notice of the giant CPD HQ building that is just a few blocks west of this place. IF ANYTHING was to go down, hurry to this refuge of safety.This following rant is not on this specific location but on McDs in general. What the hell is a friggin' McDouble and why is it replacing the double cheeseburger for 99c? A McDouble is a fancy way of saying "we jacked yo cheeze, foo!" It is a double cheeseburger with only 1 slice of cheese. 1 tiny slice of cheese is not enough to satisfy my cheeseburger craving!!!! I guess I'm too poor to be more than a Dolla Menunaire cuz I can no longer afford a double cheeseburger at $1.29 and I can only get the 99c McDouble.
Avoid this place! Î¾It's just not worth it. Î¾I live a few blocks away but I will no longer be tempted to go here for a french-fry fix. Î¾The place smells like sewer, the workers are clueless and rude, and the food tastes off. Î¾Last time I went here I ordered and stood at the counter, off to the side waiting for my simple McDouble and fries. Î¾I waited a long time and watched about 10 people behind me get their food before me. Î¾Yes, they had forgotten my simple order even though I was standing right there. Î¾Everyone decided it was someone else's problem. Î¾While waiting I had time to fully appreciate the workers' incompetence as customer after customer would ask for a certain type of soda and be informed that they were out. Î¾What did they have? No one seemed to know. Î¾Go to the McDonalds north on MLK until this neighborhood cleans itself up.
Let me say this. I have never had a bad experience at a Mcdonalds before. But this Mcdonalds is the worst. I walked in during a slow time and it was horrible. I said good morning to the girl at the register and got a confused and almost upset look. As I start to order she tells me to hold on and decided to take care of another person and forgot about me. They all have attitudes and seems miserable. I would be happy having a job and there they seem bothered. They swore at each other and acted vulgar. Do not come here.
This is my local mcdonalds and after 2 bad visits I will never go back. Learn from my mistakes and avoid it as my fellow yelpers also suggest.
The people are mostly nice at this location, but the service is the slowest I have ever seen at a Golden Arches. The drive thru is always packed, but that has less to do with them being busy than it taking forever to get your food. When you do finally get your food it is the usual McDonald's fare, so no issues there. They are also often out of ice cream, which is a drag on a hot summer day when that's all you crave. When possible I go to the McDonald's a little farther north on King Drive.
I'm not a huge fan of McDonalds in general, but I do eat at a McDonalds about once a month or so. Î¾This McDonalds is one of the worst that I've been to. Î¾The service inside was very slow. Î¾The manager, who was helping run the cash register with another employee, kept allowing other people to jump in line and then looked at the rest of us with this look of..."You don't mind, do you?" Î¾We decided to go through drive through instead hoping for faster service. Î¾We got to the speaker and the employee asks "What do you want?" Î¾Not a "How can I help you" or anything semi-customer service oriented. Î¾We decided to order anyway because my daughter was really excited for some fries. Î¾Otherwise we would have left at this point. Î¾We placed our order and then pulled up to pay. Î¾She told us one amount and then ended up giving me change for another amount. Î¾However, I didn't happen to check it until I had pulled up to the next window. Î¾We pulled up to get our order at the 2nd window and the employee asked us what we had ordered. Î¾Not just an item or two so she could make sure we were the next order, but she wanted to know everything we had ordered. Î¾I'm not sure why there was an issue in relaying the information from the 1st window to the 2nd (especially with computers). Î¾The 2nd window employee was nice and even wished us a good day. Î¾The order was right and the fries were hot. Î¾Upon looking at the receipt, the cashier did give me the correct change she just said the wrong amount. Î¾When it comes to ordering, it really bothers me when you walk into a restaurant that has their breakfast menu up even though they say they are not serving breakfast anymore. Î¾Inside the breakfast menu was up, but they told others they were not serving it anymore. Î¾In the drive thru, we asked (just in case because I really wanted a sausage biscuit) but they said again they weren't serving breakfast. Î¾The biggest problem with this was that because the breakfast menus were up the lunch menus were not and you would have had to know exactly what you wanted to get. Î¾We ended up getting the basics: fries, hamburger, drink. Î¾(I don't have the number meals memorized, and I swear they are different at each McDonalds.)Overall the service was slow and the employees were rude. Î¾It was not busy during our visit. Î¾It was 11am right before the lunch rush. Î¾I would avoid this McDonalds if you can.
Its a mcdonalds so no need for an elaborate "look at how witty i am" review.They are not the worst mcdonalds freshness/foodwise however I would have to say that about 75% of the time my order is wrong.I dont order complicated things, just standard items, minus pickles or ad mayo. Most of the time you can tell the unwanted item was just scraped off. Probably a bad idea if someone was indeed allergic to something but whatever.
This place can't get an order correct to save their livesSave yourself the headache and find another McDonald's
My expectations for McDonalds in general are pretty low, but this one lowered the bar yet another notch. Î¾Drove through at 11:40 PM on Sat, Feb 26. Î¾Ordered #2 (Quarter Pounder with Cheese) with a bottle of water. Î¾ I never customize because that increases the probability of mistakes. Î¾Burger was fine. Î¾Fries were cold and rubbery. Î¾I am guessing that the fries had been sitting for some time to begin with, and they put 'em in the bag while waiting for the burger. Î¾I drove away before I discovered the cold fries. Î¾Didn't feel like turning around and going back. Î¾Worst part might have been the guy who handed the food out the window, without a greeting, without a thank-you, without a word. Î¾Knowing he was serving me crappy cold fries. Î¾That part really pisses me off. Î¾I would NEVER accept that kind of service from one of my employees. Î¾Very disappointed - as usual. Î¾When will I learn?
I had want here with my friend(1time) and my mom (2 time) it just like a regular McDonald`s they cook the food and you just keep it moving i just hate there is not a lot of seats to sit other then that i don`t have a issue with it my honest opinion :)
You burned my coffee. You guys burned my coffee. First time I ever ordered coffee from you and you burned it. I usually go to the Starbucks right across the street because they usually don't burn my coffee. I attempted to try out your establishment because you guys advertise your coffee so much on all sorts of media implicating that it's good coffee that isn't burned. But after giving tender, I received a burned coffee. This will be the last time I visit you to buy a burned coffee. You burned my coffee. Burn.P.S. Dear cashier lady. I know you weren't the one who physically burned my coffee so my earlier comments do not apply to you. But I did ask TWICE for a chorizo and not a sausage burrito. I would have overlooked this had you not been so mean to me. I hope you enter a Starbucks one day and your coffee is burned.
They have a bad service by drive-throughEvery time I take my food it missing something or they give me different orderActually I don't like this location so now I stopped taking my food from there.Just to review you this 1 star it's too much
Take your life in your hands at this location. Î¾Before the remodeled, this alternated between being a homeless hangout and a gang hideout. Î¾Now they have two--TWO!--security people patrolling, so I'll at least feel safe having a quick bite before the late evening backpack snatchings start.
At random times of day they will say "cash only and only these items are sold" if you want anything else or don't have cash, they turn you away. Very rude staff, too.
Normally I don't bother reviewing places like this, but this McDonalds is so hilariously awful that I felt it was my duty to share this information with fellow Yelpers.The irony of this specific McDonalds is that it is an exceptionally nice one both inside and out. It is ultra-modern with a great little outdoor garden with seats! I've never seen a McDonalds like this before.Unfortunately it is absolute chaos inside. As some other reviewers have said, the staff have no control over it and it turns into a free-for-all. I honestly think Chicago PD needs to have a few officers staffed inside this place 24/7, since there are always a lot of sketchy things going on. I'm surprised no one has been stabbed and/or shot.Even if you are just passing by, you will immediately know something is up with this place. There are no less than 20 strange characters loitering outside of it pretty much all day, making weird comments at strangers. Again, it's nothing short of a miracle that people haven't been stabbed or shot here. I make it a point to walk past as quickly as possible and not make eye contact since the people loitering out front always give me weird looks and act like they want to fight.Seriously, if this place got bulldozed tomorrow morning I don't think anyone would shed a tear and the adjacent buildings' property values would quadruple. Businesses like this are the reason Yelp needs negative stars.Also, I LOL'd at the photos making this look like a classy place. It is not.
Not the best location right by the red line station. Just your average McDonald's food.
I came in here late at night to order something to absorb some alcohol I had ingested. The manager clearly has no control over the staff. Or, he/she is friends with all of them and they all do whatever they want. I'm pretty sure the cashier made plans with the guy in front of me to hook up when her shift was over. The person they had cleaning the dining room was acting as though it was his territory and lining up chairs so that people could not sit where he had cleaned.......except it's open 24 hours. While I was there I could have a) bought crack b) hired a prostitute c) been beaten up Î¾or, d) been robbed at gunpoint. I would not recommend that you visit this establishment. Do so at your own risk.
What a trash bin.Popped in here for a quick coffee, and it was brutal for even the short time it took to drink it. Couple of trashy women arguing loudly and profanely, I thought at one point there was going to be a weave on the ground. Staff does nothing, violators are not ejected. Shady guys hanging out in front of doors, very awkward to even enter this place.So, don't. Pass it up. Terrible.
Came here for some breakfast.The seating is nice and large, and bright and clean. Î¾It was comfy chilling here.The food I had was typical of other locations. Î¾No complaints there.Lastly, there's a 24h drive-through available here as well.
I don't go to this McDonalds much since I dont work in Water Tower anymore.They have remodeled it twice that I remember.It is still the same old homeless shelter it was.I went here last night around 6pm for dinner. Two guys in the dining room didn't even buy anything they just were sitting there talking and using swear words and being racist. Î¾I finished eating so I went and used the restroom. Î¾As I opened the door I bumped a homeless guy in the restroom using the hand dryer to warm up his chicken wings he got from jewel. Î¾I was like Smh....They used to have a Security Guard here Idk were he was last night. Î¾We also had a homless guy next to us draw us on his pencil and paper. Î¾Not bad tbhAll I can say is eat and go......
Worst McDonalds I have ever been. I hope I can give it zero star.
I'm so sorry this is right down the block from where I work. Î¾Fortunately there is another McDonald's in the area to make up for this one.For starters, the people hanging out in front of the restaurant....most of them look absolutely creepy. Î¾Depending on the time of day or night, you might have to seriously watch your back....or avoid this place.Secondly, the customer service in this place is absolutely ridiculous at times. Î¾I was in here today and ordered a large coke with easy ice. Î¾That's all I ordered. Î¾No big macs, no fries, none of that. Î¾What was absolutely shocking was that not only did I have to wait FIVE MINUTES for a soft drink, but people that came in AFTER me that ordered actual food (that had to be cooked) was getting their orders BEFORE me while the staff members just stood around and chatted about non-important things.Sorry. Î¾You only have one time to irk me, and you've done it. Î¾Won't be going back here. Î¾Try the McDonald's over on McClurg; they're better.
I rate this McDonald's 2-3/4 stars. Its a downtown McDonald's at the crossroads of State and Chicago Streets at the entrance to the subway. Î¾ One word describes this McDonald's: busy. It seems that this McDonald's is marketed to the commuters exiting the subway and driving on Chicago Street with its giant arches hanging above the subway exit at Chicago Street. The result is that this McDonald's is busy. Even outside there are usually people hanging out, including the homeless. Î¾This Mcdonald's is relatively large. There was no problem getting a table. And there was breathing room. Î¾Because this McDonald's is busy and the employees were overworked while being on the friendly side, I will not dwell on the fact that they forgot my order and napkins. I will just knock off half a star. Î¾This McDonald's is convenient, and relatively inexpensive. Whether its one or five stars, the convenience and ample seating makes up for the flaws. Î¾Closing up this review, I have two tips. If you are not in a rush, I recommend the cool Rock & Roll McDonald's. And if you want great chicken nuggets and waffle fries, Chick-Fil-Le is a couple doors down.
My impression of this place is still that it should probably be razed to the ground. They only sell 'bottled water' at this McDonald's, even though the area in front of the building is the site of known and newsworthy episodes of "WILDING", with about 200 teenagers trying to cause trouble out front. Î¾Not only do they have terrible security guards, tons of unruly teens and others, but they can't even accommodate a customer by doing something so simple as selling and providing a cup of water with ice in it, even though they can make an iced coffee. Î¾Pullleeezzzeee...They ought to hire a private special ops security force to stand out front so that the 5 policemen who seem to be permanently stationed there can spend their time other places too.
what i liked best is the fast service with a smile . the food is always hot and fresh . i like the apple pies the price is always right and its not to bad for noise it had avarage Î¾costmers
Fast and friendly service. My daughter enjoyed her hot cakes and has brown. Really huge inside. Weird people in here but can't blame the place for it.
This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to, and I LOVE McDonald's and all its cheap, bad-for-you food glory.I am a graduate student at nearby Loyola University, so I come here often to grab lunch to go as quickly as possible before scurrying out the door and seeking refuge in my classrooms to devour my goods.The first time I ordered from here, my hamburger bun was HARD. Completely stale. Assuming this was just a fluke, I continued to frequent this fine dining establishment.The next few times weren't so bad, but the fries are consistently lackluster and are flavorless, hard, and taste "old"; the antithesis of the coveted McDonald's french fry!Last time I ordered a hamburger (this was last week!), the bun had marks on it that literally looked like black tire tracks running across the length of the bun. I'm not sure how this could have possibly happened, but then again, I really am not that curious. This is an "okay" place if you're looking for a cheap lunch in the city, but be careful to avoid the questionable individuals loitering inside and out!
Old MickeyDs. Not at all what it used to be. But in particular this one, on Chi Ave at exit of the red line. Stopped in there, 1st time ever, to get a peppermint mocha coffee (hot), coffee not meant to be cold. I counted, there was one person overwhelmed on the cash register as, I counted, 17 people stood in line waiting for service. I counted again, 1 person making special coffee, 2 passing out orders and pouring regular coffee, 1 doing absolutely notta, saw 1 in the kitchen area. That's 5, its 7 A.M., this is McDonalds, in the heart of Chicago, where are the other 10 employees? Service here: HorribleRecommendation: Do not go herePeppermint Mocha Coffee (hot): Absolutely vile, ghastly, disgusting.Best thing here: Free Wi-FiDunkin Donuts & Starbucks do not worry, McDonalds poses no threat at stealing the real coffee drinkers.
