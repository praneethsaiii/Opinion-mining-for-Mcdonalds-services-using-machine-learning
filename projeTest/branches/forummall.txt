I'm not a huge mcds lover, but I've been to better ones. This is by far the worst one I've ever been too! It's filthy inside and if you get drive through they completely screw up your order every time! The staff is terribly unfriendly and nobody seems to care.
Terrible customer service. Î¾I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. Î¾There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window. Î¾ I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.
First they "lost" my order, actually they gave it to someone one else than took 20 minutes to figure out why I was still waiting for my order.They after I was asked what I needed I replied, "my order".They asked for my ticket and the asst mgr looked at the ticket then incompletely filled it.I had to ask her to check to see if she filled it correctly.She acted as if she couldn't be bothered with that so I asked her again.She begrudgingly checked to she did in fact miss something on the ticket.So after 22 minutes I finally had my breakfast biscuit platter.As I left an woman approached and identified herself as the manager, she was dressed as if she had just awoken in an old t-shirt and sweat pants.She said she had heard what happened and said she'd take care of it.Well why didn't she intervene when she saw I was growing annoyed with the incompetence?
I see I'm not the only one giving 1 star. Only because there is not a -25 Star!!! That's all I need to say!
Well, it's McDonald's, so you know what the food is. Î¾This review reflects solely on the poor service. Î¾I have been to this location countless times over the years. Î¾They consistently fail on the service end of things. Î¾The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of "sighs" and "lip smacking" when you talk to them. Î¾So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. Î¾The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Î¾Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. Î¾I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. Î¾I could not recommend this location any less. Î¾If you can wait, take a pass. Î¾There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.
This has to be one of the worst and slowest McDonald's franchises there is. Can't figure out why my Egg McMuffin is always on a stale un-toasted English muffin. Bought A chocolate shake today and threw it away.
I'm not crazy about this McDonald's. Î¾This is primarily because they are so slow. Î¾My gosh what exactly is the hold up? Î¾It's FAST food people. Î¾Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. Î¾I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Î¾Spread the word. Î¾Anyway, this location is on a little access road Î¾and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. Î¾It would have helped if there was one. Î¾So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. Î¾This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.
One Star and I'm beng kind. I blame management. last day of free coffee so "we" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. "Which one is which?" I asked... and he smiled and said "One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?
Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.
This McDonald's has gotten much better. Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.
Let's start here only reason I came into McDonald's waste time till girlfriend flight arrives and Î¾for my duaghters. I don't eat fast food ordered two happy meals slow service... While ordering my food Î¾a guy ask the cashier two use his cell in the middle of my order that was strike one then give me little boy toys knowing I have twin girls stabding right in front of him. Im glad I will never have to return here I live way in sandy springs.... I can see the difference between service and the staff The building it self is brand new change your staff this is Blackmac not McDonald's im black myself but telling the truth
Other businesses throughout Metro Atlanta opened their doors to stranded motorists during the Jan. 2014 snow storm. This McDonald's on Camp Creek Parkway told Î¾a group of senior citizens who were on the way home from an outing that they had to leave their restaurant. Î¾All they cared about was the dollar. Î¾After they got that, they were done with them. Î¾Too bad they couldn't have made it down the street to Wendy's or Chic Fil A and other restaurants.
The drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review.This is one of those two lane drive thrus, and I know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window, but almost everytime, the cashier ends up asking me what did I order. Î¾I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer. One of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice. When you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits, but not at this location.
Believe it or not, this used to be q really good McDonalds. The drive throuh is so slow, it is frustrating but the service is always friendly. Food is normally luke warm. My niece likes the toys from McDonalds, I wonder if I pull up to the window and say, let me just get the toy, woulf service be faster?
As the previous yelpers have already stated, this place is pretty slow. The food is usually cold.. and the service....yeah. you guessed it. Poor.
25 minutes in drive through line. Gunshots from the apartments behind. Î¾Worst McDonald's ever!
Super slow service, food's terrible like its been sitting and then reheated. Î¾Everything is out, napkins, iced tea
SLOW-SLOW-SLOW! Î¾Don't go here if you have a flight to catch...or a life to live!!!!! Î¾If you're hungry, wait until you get to the airport. Î¾This particular McDonald's is just not worth your time.
On your way to the airport or just cruising down Camp Creek Pkwy? Î¾Are you absolutely in Love with McDonald's Sweet Tea? Well then don't ever go through this drive thru. Î¾Hands down this is the slowest McDonald's drive thru I've experienced in Atlanta. Î¾Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. Î¾As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. Î¾She told a few of her associates that it was like "syrup" and "liquid diabetes". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! Î¾Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink. So the moral to the story is, if you're on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport, bypass McDonald's and head for Chick-fil-A. #EatMoreChicken
This is the worst McDonalds I have ever seen. Î¾The service was terrible and the employees were either lazy or incompetent. I will never return to this establishment.
I had the McCafe Mocha and must say that it was better than drinking sand and salt water, that's about it.Too sweet and I couldn't even taste the coffee over the other weird flavors going on in this drink.Stick with the Starbucks mocha, folks. Î¾Trust me on this one.
GHETTO!! went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces. Î¾Finally made it inside and it was about 5 customers to one cashier. The shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line. Î¾Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don't like to feel like I am in someone's "hood" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don't care or maybe even steal themselves. Î¾plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes
I visited mcdonalds on Dec 20, 2011 at 12:54 I bought 3 cheese burgers 2 large fries and 2 orders of pies. Î¾They charged me for 3 fries so I went back into store and told the cashier. She denied I said Î¾ I ordered 2 fries. Î¾Then manager came over and said whats the problem. I told him and he said looked into the bag, grabbed the xtra fries and lterally threw them into the waste bucket by the drive tru from the cashier . Î¾Then reached into cash register and gave me change for the fries. Î¾Then i said thank you and he said ok boss and I left. Î¾I then called mcdonalds people via the nimber on the website after I ate. I told then I was going to wait to yelp after I heard from McDonalds. Î¾Still no call or email. Î¾As a side note ...Tom N. Î¾(the otther yelper) is right, they are very rude there and seem bothered to help you and not at all nice to the kids. Î¾The play room is sticky and the video games in ther always cause an altercation with kids and parents. Î¾The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the fries were hot and the sweet potatoe fries were good and warm.
I usually hit the drive thru once or twice a week for breakfast. A lot of times the forget to include the hash brown if I order a meal. If I order hot cakes they usually forget either butter or utinsils prompting me to have to go inside. The food is also very inconsistent.
What a joke.Don't do take out as you will not get anything that you ordered. We prefers and paid for items only to get home with 50% of the order accurate. I've been there numerous times and sadly the same thing happens. It's my fault because I should learn.Does anyone know the owner?I can't believe that he would like this comment. Woodstock Macdonalds is not the place that Ray Crock invented. Save yourself the frustration and waste if money, don't go there!I've learned now.
I wish I can give zero stars. Freezing cold reheated soggy fries and twice fried chewy nuggets = straight to my trash can.
I agree with most reviewers on this one. Staff is always rude and annoyed that you're there!!1 I travel weekly to Atlanta Hartsfield Airport and this McDonald's never has fresh hot coffee at 4:30/5:00 AM. Always have to wait while they brew coffee, WTH!!
I don't think this location deserves even one star. Î¾This is the filthiest McDonalds I have ever visited. Î¾I have been to hundreds of different McDonalds in numerous states as well as 19 foreign countries. I went to this location on 3/29/12 for breakfast. Î¾The first thing I noticed was that the floor was sticky. (A previous reviewer made a similar comment about the play area.) When I noticed this, I said to myself, "this isn't right." Î¾Then when I looked for a place to sit, I spotted all the debris in the seat crevices and the floor. There were also flies in the dining area which I had to repeatedly brush off my food. Î¾As for the food, it seemed OK, except, this was the first time ever that I was given cold syrup for my hotcakes at a McDonalds..
This is one rude Mcdonalds! The food takes longer to prepare than any other Macdonalds I have ever been to. The people working there always seem annoyed like you are bothering them just by being there. I avoid this mc d's whenever I can.
the managers at this mcdonalds are awesome but some of the workers are lazy. Î¾overall an average mcdonalds. Î¾after visiting it and some other once i realized that this one is really average. Î¾the only thing good about this one is that the management is awesome and its across the street from my house so i can sit around and study till midnight and no one bothers me.
It had been a while since I had stopped at this particular one. Î¾They have done a total remodel and it looks fairly fresh. Î¾Stopped by about Î¾10-11pm and went through drive thru. Î¾I thought I'd try a new McWrap. Î¾Got a fry and a spicy chick along with that. Î¾ I was asked to pull up after sitting at the window for a few minutes and they would bring me Î¾my order. Î¾That is fine, except about 15 minutes later I'm still waiting. Î¾So I go to check what is going on and end up waiting another 5 minutes. Î¾ It appeared I wasn't the only one that had a long wait in drive thru as well. Î¾ McWrap - I was disappointed. Î¾Looked like a wrap that had grilled chicken sprinkle with some mixed greens, then had sweet and sour sauce dumped in it.
Disorganized. Î¾Didn't even get to order. Employees were hanging out with friends out front.
This has got to be one of the busiest McDonald's in the metro area ... if not the southeast ... and they are fairly efficient despite being so busy all the time.You can come by just about any time of the day and find the line of cars for the "drive-thru" wrapped around the building...It's generally more efficient to go into the building and place your order than wait in the line of cars spewing smog... and since the building is open 24 hours now that should make it easy to get your McFix...good job, Clairmont McDonald's!
THIS MCDONALDS IS HORRIBLE! They are also down the street from my house. You might just want to go to the next McDonald's down the street, less than half a mile maybe. It's brand new and just opened. The reviews here speak for themselves. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER. they always rush you at drive-thru and never get the meal correct because they are all ignorant fucks who can't speak proper English or don't even know English. They don't even give you time to respond on an order completion. I've dined inside and it was fine, however it was dirty around me on most occasions. But 99% of the time I eat there, MY MEAL IS ALWAYS INCORRECT! Always! It's ridiculous! I found out it's an ongoing problem; especially at this store. The fries are always pre sorted and they are a hot or miss. They are really good or really bad, which is really annoying. The sandwich is the same, sometimes they put fresh dripping meat on the bun and it makes it soggy, which is disgusting. Most of the times the sandwich is just plain incorrect. I've had to call corporate about the poor customer service I've had with employees and several managers at this location; as well as the constant issue of my order being messed up (which is very inconvenient in drive-thru). I'm telling you, go to the next McDonald's. The employees here hate their job and are idiots.
Nuts and bolts: Stopped by on my way into work to grab breakfast after getting some Sam's Club gas.Pros: Convenient location for me, right off I-85. Fast service.Cons: The sausage biscuit I had was sub-par. Î¾The biscuit was overcooked and hard. Î¾The sausage was not cooked enough. Î¾Only gave me one jelly packet. Î¾Most places give me at least two. Î¾Forgot to give me a straw for my sweet tea. Î¾Sweet tea was not sweet enough. Î¾Gave me no napkins. Î¾Neutral: Î¾When I was in line paying, a woman pulled up next to me to complain to the cashier that something was wrong with her order. Î¾So she jumped in front of me to get her order fixed. Î¾Neutral about this since I don't have details.Take home: I will try them one more time. Î¾If they fail again, I will just pass.
The ice cream machine is always "down" after 11 p.m. If you want a hot fudge sundae, don't even bother.
Regular McDonald's. Close to the highway which can be good and bad.
Stopped here on the way downtown this morning to get a yogurt parfait. Î¾These snakes gave me dairy products that had an expired "use by" sticker and I didn't even notice until I was halfway to downtown. Gross, guys. Î¾There's no point in putting freshness dates on your food if the employees can't or won't read.
I highly recommend this McDonalds!******if and only if you are trapped at Northside Hospital, are ravenously hungry, and have absolutely no other option. Î¾Eating at this McDonalds is slightly better than eating out of a vending machine or dumpster.
TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others "trapped" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself "trapped" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). Î¾God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ Î¾YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls! How many more years will you ignore not only the unhealthy food options McDonalds supplies~ but to continue to ALLOW a daily dose of DELIBERATE and DILIGENT unhealthy, negative, and "put upon" attitudes from employees, to be delivered to family, friends and employees that are there only because they CARE and are there for YOUR patients! HOW this does NOT cause you to react and ACT is beyond me.In my world, with SO MANY options available, this place would be GONE ~ like TODAY; certainly NOT any longer than tomorrow!This toxic waste site is dumping daily doses of negativity, inhumanity~ its seeping and reverberating within the walls of this hospital. I know you FEEL IT!
I know i shouldn't need to ask but experience has proven it's a good I idea, tonight I forgot Î¾to ask them to make sure the coffee wasn't old and after i drove any i checked and it was not only old it was cold!
I don't often eat at McDonald's, or ever in fact. I don't have much expectation for healthy foods but the one thing I do expect is decent service and fast food. This branch for neither. Food was really slow to come out and I had to ask thrice for the coffee that i ordered. Shocking service delivery
Little bit more expensive than other Mickey Dee's. Beggars can't be choosy. Slow service and it's packed. its open 24/7/365. and the workers are pretty nice. didn't have many other choices and this filled the need.
This is the McDonald's inside the Northside Hospital.For being the only option to get something to eat (evidently they don't have a proper cafeteria like most hospitals do) it had to do...Complete disorganization are the only two decent words I can come up for this place. Î¾There was a huge rush of people oddly enough that evening, and the staff had no clue what to do. Î¾Orders were wrong, missing items, and the wait time was unbearable.
The worst McDonalds ever. Complete chaos. The prices are higher than the average and they don't have all of the regular items like lattes or fraps. The staff seems to be uninterested in taking or completing your order. It is as if they are aware that you are pretty much at their mercy.
A captive audience of transient visitors and exhausted staff are the only way this McDonalds, which is basically the only food option at Northside Hospital, could possibly stay in business.
AND STILL FRENCH FRY CHAMP.........The burger taste not sop much.... But this location fast and friendly.
BEWARE! I saw the manager filling orders for drive-thru customers using bare hands - no gloves or utensils to pack fries - and this is the weirdest thing ever: she was 'fingering' plastic cup lids!?! Don't know what else to call it! She poked her finger through the plastic cup lids (in the slit made for straws) before inserting straws! What the hell for? Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cup lid before inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! The straw can be used to go through the straw slit! No need for a finger nail! FILTHY! I saw this going on inside while the poor folks in drive-thru didn't see this! And the cashier had a bad cold and was wiping his runny nose all over with the back of his hand! What can you expect if the manager herself is filthy and polluting the food! Who knows where her hand'a been?
Worst Mc Donalds in all of Atlanta... 15-25 min stop every time even if they have no customers. Straight ridiculous. I live across the street and REFUSE to stop there. Nope I will NEVER give anyone my money who to a location doesn't value and appreciate it. Same manager every time... common trend? called regional, pretended to care. Either way... only thing they will give you is COLD food after a 30 min wait, a major headache and crappy service! SKIP THIS STOP!
Its good. 24hr
What the freak-nik is this?There are 25 cars in the drive thru at 9am. Î¾Is everybody going to Mickey Dees today?You can guess that volumes of business like this, means that someone's going to get their order wrong...and today it was me.They put cheese on my steak BISCUIT, but I requested a steak and egg BAGEL. I had to request a straw for my large soda. Î¾Guess I should have checked my sandwich while I looked for the missing straw.I expect much better from a Mickey Dee's
I've enjoyed a couple eggwhite delights here, but not much else. I usually really like McDonald's salads as a quick, relatively healthy option on a tight budget, but the salads I've had at this particular restaurant has been just kind of gross.
Sometimes, you just need a Mickey D's fix. Usually, for me anyway, that "sometime" is very late at night - er, early in the morning, depending on how you want to slice it.24-hour drive thru - check. Fries still made fresh at all hours - check, check. A double cheeseburger for a steal ($1) and a Coke to go with. CHECK! Yep, all your drive-thru goody/bad-ness waiting for you.Yum.
My order was fresh and prepared correctly. They were friendly and moved the drive-thru line quickly during the lunch rush. Very good!
The worst McDonalds franchise I've visited. Î¾I fired off complaints to McDonalds Corp. Î¾thinking they might want something for their file to rid themselves of this lazy franchisee & all I got was a lame apology months later w/ a coupon for more food! Î¾It was well after the dinner rush, every table was dirty, floors so sticky I almost walked outta my shoes, surly staff, just plain dirty.
I've gone to this McDonald's several times and they've gotten my order completely wrong. I go there before work around 7:30 so I'm very hungry and I order a bacon egg and cheese biscuit... Once I get to work I find what is in my bag is actually an egg mcmuffin...I absolutely hate those..so of course it's too late for me to drive back and get my correct order. I dont expect this to happen and its a elveru bisy mcdonalds so i dont stop at the srive thru to check my bag.I'd just like to say,if this happened once In a blue moon,that's fine. Mistakes happen..but not this many times. Over it. I also notice that while I'm giving my order at the drive thru,the person taking it is either never paying attention or rude. I wish this would change.. This McDonald's seems to be constantly packed with people in the morning because its on a very high traffic road so they need to reevaluate their customer service.
This is the most disgusting McDonalds on the planet. Î¾Doubt me? Î¾Go into this nauseating cesspool and find out for yourself. Î¾I was shocked because it was in a very nice area and has a playground. Î¾It is by far the nastiest McDonald's I have ever been into.
"I gotta wake my ass up at six AM every day of this week and drag myself up to Vascalinas. Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there at the new McDonalds." -- Office Space (1999)So what a difference a complete overhaul makes. Î¾This location was recently LEVELED and rebuilt - and they did a complete 180 - and when I say that, the building was even rotated by 90 degrees.So this is in an area where most of the streets around it are one way, so it can be confusing to get in and out of - and the previous drive-thru began and ended in different places. Î¾Now, they redesigned the place so that it makes more sense and the flow works even better than before - and the previous location was there for 30 years? Î¾Wow.The new one is sleek, clean, modern and beautiful. Î¾The drive-thru staff was super friendly (I was buying a Sprite for heaven's sake) and both the young lady who took my money and the one who handed me my drink said "we hope to see you back here again soon." Î¾That's great service, personable and I would be happy to return (not that I do McD's very often). Î¾But I'm more apt to come to this one than any other.
This is by far the worse McDonald's I've ever been too. My bf wanted their chicken nuggets because it was $1.99 for 10 pieces. We got there and placed an order for 30 pieces. It took us 15 minutes to get it and he was charged twice the amount. We were told by the cashier that the manager would fix this problem and he never did until we had to ask ourselves. Overall it took a long time to get our food, we received the wrong sauces, and it was an overall poor experience. I will not return to this location.
Food is what you would expect from McDonald's but the management and staff could use some coaching in customer service. Î¾I come to this restaurant frequently in the mornings & the manager always seems to have a surly attitude. Î¾He acts as though he is doing you a big favor to wait on you and even take your money
Went to order a meal via drive through and there was a live roach (not waterbug) on the window crawling in mid day. I showed it to the gentleman that was collecting my payment and he never noticed the roach there. I canceled my order immediately and drove away.
Before a morning round of golf, I needed a quick breakfast. Î¾It had to be quick because I needed to make my tee time. Î¾It had to be big because I needed energy for the course. Î¾I stopped into this Mickey D's and right behind the register I saw "Big Breakfast with Hotcakes." Î¾Sounded good to me.Just seconds after swiping my credit card, I was handed a tray with three hotcakes (McDonald's pancakes), scrambled eggs, a sausage patty, a biscuit, and a McDonald's hash brown. Î¾Oh yeah, and two containers each of syrup and butter. Î¾All this for less than five bucks. Î¾Now that's what I call fast food. Î¾It's fast and it's cheap. Î¾This is why America has an obesity problem.Nearing the end of my meal, I started to realize that it was a lot of food. Î¾I can eat a lot and I could have probably done OK without the extra hash brown or biscuit (I was also rushing). Î¾For three pancakes, I only needed one container of syrup. Î¾I like their butter. Î¾It's very wispy. Î¾Everything was good and tasted consistent with what you'd expect of McDonald's. Î¾Out of curiosity, I went to McDonald's web site to see how many calories was in this meal: 1,090.
My Wife and I have been to this McDonalds about 10 times since the rebuild. There is a whole new staff of people working there. In the 10 visits we have yet to get a complete order. I went inside the restaurant this evening in hopes of eliminating the issue we had been having. I ordered 2 quarter pounders, 2 apple pies and 1 hamburger. I was given my order to go, missing the 2 apple pies and hamburger. Beware if you go to this McDonalds and check your order.
Typical McDonald's restaurant located at Powers Ferry and New Northside on the north end of the perimeter. I have always avoided this location due to the fact that I'm not really a fan of McDonald's in general, but the other morning on my way to work I was craving some breakfast and only had time to pull into a drive-thru and grab a quick bite to go. Since McDonald's is the only place with a drive-thru on my way to work I stopped by here to grab their special 2 bacon, egg, & cheese biscuits for $2.50. The food was ok, just tasted like you would expect McDonald's food to taste. The service was pretty good at the drive-thru, they were friendly enough. But what really gets me is how lazy has America become that the drive-thru welcome and what would you like to order has to be automated at McDonald's.
It'll make ya fat
On my way to Curry Honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment, I went to the drive-thru of this McDonald's since it was so conveniently located almost adjacent to the Honda dealership. Î¾It was around 1:45 pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there were probably only two cars in front of me, so I thought I'd be in and out of there quickly. Î¾What I thought would be a "quick" drive-thru took over ten minutes. Î¾I'm not sure what the hold up was, but perhaps one (or both) of the cars in front of me got a large order. Î¾All I ordered was a Spicy McChicken Sandwich, small fries, and a cup of ice water.Again, Curry Honda is located super close to the McDonald's, so the food should have still been hot (or at least warm) when I got there. Î¾However, when I sat down to eat my food in the waiting room, I noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm, and the ice in my water was almost completely melted. Î¾I guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while, and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers. Î¾Boo. Î¾It was my first time trying the Spicy McChicken Sandwich, and I thought it was decent. Î¾It has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol' McChicken Sandwich.Overall, this McDonald's gets 3 stars for being "OK." Î¾Yes, service could have been quicker, and the food should have been served hotter, but this is a McDonald's and at least the employees were friendly. Î¾I may return to this McDonald's if I'm on my way to Curry Honda and didn't have time to grab food elsewhere, but it wouldn't be my top choice for fast food in the area.[Review 324 of 366]
Just sat at drive thru several minutes no one is answering. I can see employees walking around and it is 5:48 am and they should be open. I wonder if this franchises owner is aware that he is losing business due to this. I bet they do and dont care.
Holy crap dudes, this is the fastest McDonald's in Atlanta. Î¾I placed a special order during rush hour (two Egg McMuffins with no Canadian bacon), and by the time I reached the pickup window someone was already walking my order to the window.And they even got it just the way I like it -- no eggshells!
I purchased a specialty coffee in the drive through, but soon after I pulled out and away I realized I had been given a black coffee for the price of $3. Mistakes happen so I kept my receipt and went back exactly a week later within the hour, since I was making the same trip. I went inside, out of respect to show my face that I wasn't trying to scam them, and the manager was working the register. I told him what happened and that I'd like the specialty coffee I originally ordered. He pointed that it had been a week since the original purchase and that he needed proof I wasn't lying about my incorrect order. Mind you, at 6:30am 6 people were all waiting around for their order, which shows slow and poor service. I didn't argue and I walked away leaving my receipt on the counter. I was simply asking for a coffee, not even an entire meal. I don't post about these sort of things, but this time was different. The manager could have easily offered a variety of resolutions, but all he said was "no I'm sorry". Well, I'm sorry, but I've never been so dissatisfied with customer service and let alone management of a restaurant! Please stay away from this location for the sake of your pockets and your sanity.
the last 20 times we been to this McDonald's they screw up the order at the drive thru and walk in the guy with the Afro don't care I think he's a manager
I've generally had good service here, but this morning at the drive-thru was the pits. Î¾I was initially 6 cars back from ordering, and it seriously took me about 10 minutes to get my food. Î¾When I was ordering, I had to repeat it four times very slowly and they still got my drink size wrong. Î¾When I got it, my food was great, but the visit was very painful overall. Î¾I hope this visit was a fluke. . .
Hot fries i like.
The customer service was HORRIBLE! Î¾They seemed angry to work here and they would get upset if you ask for more ketchup or condiments. Also, the kids play area was filthy. It had old dirty food on the floor and it was Î¾full of lint. Stay away from this location.
Customer service is well below par here. I placed my order through the intercom and was told that I'd have to pay in separate transactions if I were to use more than 1 coupon. I expected that and was fine with it up until I got to the window in which one of the girls working the cashier had a problem with me using the coupons and I quote, mentioned, "I don't give a d*** and a f*** what she wants." I never make it a goal to be difficult to other people and I find it very rude, let alone unnecessary, that I received this treatment. It is part of your job's duties to simply put in a customer's order. If you don't like your job, you have no business being there, and there are plenty of job seekers out there who would be more deserving of your position. To top it off, after I left the restaurant, I opened my bag to find out that I didn't receive everything I ordered and paid for.
Food is good but what's with all the flies and nats always in the air? Î¾I've mentoned this to management before but it seems like nothing has changed. Î¾ I'm going to the McDonald's on Hudson Bridge from now on.
Fruit flies anyone? There is a huge fruit fly infestation here. I have been here twice in 3 months and the problem still exists.
Best McDonalds ice cream is here!
This is a busy Mcdonalds at all times even late at night. The drive thru seems to be where they are doing most of their business when I visit the area. I have never had a problem out of service here as I am one those who use the drive thru too. My order is always right. It's within walking distance of several hotels. Î¾ Î¾I do not know anything about the dining area since I always use the drive thru. Customer service has been great as they always take care of me.When I go to McDonalds I get either the Big Mac meal or the quarter pounder meal. Big Macs are popular because of the secret tangy orange sauce they put on them. Their quarter pounders are just like eating a moist cheese burger. It's all hood here.
I would honestly not normally take the time to review a McDonald's location since I'm only really a fan of their breakfast, but this place has some serious issues. Apparently the difference between "sausage and egg" and "sausage egg and cheese" is not obvious/important to whoever they have bagging orders, even though they are two distinctly different items ON THEIR MENU! I have been down the road at least three times now only to find that they've given me the wrong biscuit - even when the correct one is on my receipt. Not to mention, the sweet tea has often tasted like hairspray. I have never experienced such consistently poor service from a single fast food location.
Came here for a quick to go lunch. First my cheeseburgers were not right, I had requested no onions, and they were covered with them. Then second, the fries were so mushy and not fresh. I was sorely disappointed
The first time I went here they smothered my burger with mustard and ketchup to where it was dripping on me, and the past two times I have been here the fries are old and dark, and they put like one peice of bacon on my burger. They offered me free fries tomorrow. Ha horrible place to eat
the worst mcd's I've ever been to. tried to get a quick snack during our long drive and it was the worst decision. the dual lane drive through is anything but fast. one car in front of me but somehow the other lane was the only one moving. some 10 odd minutes later, we finally ordered. one of the cars in front of me obviously knew somebody in the place and just kept talking at the window. it wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't continued for so long. after 20+ minutes of sitting in this line, fighting the urge to just drive off, and watching the multiple levels of poor service, we finally got our snack and the freaking fries were cold. I should have taken 2 minutes to read the reviews before I went here and it would have stopped me from ever going. you would think after all that time, at least the food would be hot. HA. just do yourself a favor and find another mcd's to visit. truly a disappointing stop. :-(
This mcdonalds truly is the worst. They are always EXTREMELY slow and understaffed. Many of the workers her are rude and obviously dont want to be there. My food comes out decent but they are always out of something everytime I go. I probably will never come to this location again.
The evening manager here is very nice and has a great attitude. I went inside of this McDonald's one afternoon when the drive through was backed up and the manager helped me immediately. She was the only person who actually looked like she was happy to help customers, which made me very comfortable, it looked like she even gave me a little extra fries!
Good job guys, love the friendly staff. Î¾Dt hopping.Not sure what they are experiencing, but one of the bet McD in area. Î¾So much better than before. Î¾Love the Christian music guys.
worst drove thru ever. Î¾I was car #7 sitting in a dual drive thru for 8 minutes and not 1 car had moved. I park and go inside. the manager waits on me and I said that the drive thru has not moved. she says, " yeah our drive thru system has gone done". I said " it would be nice if someone would walk out there and tell everyone and post a sign". she walks away to fill my order, only to leave one of her long BLEACHED hairs in between my 2 frozen strawberry lemonades.
I'm not ashamed to admit that I frequent this McDonald's at least twice a week. Î¾Need a snack after pumping gas? Î¾Need coffee before Chocolatte is open or after Chocolatte is closed? Î¾Need night-after-drinking breakfast? Î¾Yes, please on all counts. Î¾I haven't found this McDonald's to be particularly slow. Î¾It is a bit sketch by Decatur standards, although it's North Decatur and not Decatur proper. Î¾Often at night there are folks who look homeless here, though only one one occasion has anything particularly creepy/disturbing happened regarding said demographic of patron. Î¾Otherwise, it's lots of Emory students and hospital workers and high school students from Druid Hills High. Î¾I like that the workers seem to have a good camaraderie with each other. Î¾I also like that folks remember my standard order and can associate my voice with my order when I go through the drive thru.
This is the worst McDonald's I have ever visited. Î¾We sat at the drive-thru window forever watching the employees goof off. Î¾The fish sandwich was edible in a square processed fish, round bun, too much tartar sauce sort of way. Î¾The french fries were horrible. Î¾They were not edible. Î¾They were stale and greasy.Just because someone is holding a broom does not mean that they are sweeping. Î¾The broom is a prop to make people think they are working while they are socializing with co-workers. Î¾They will look at you occasionally while they continue to goof off. Î¾The employees seem to go out of their way to prove that you aren't worth their time. Î¾This McDonald's really sucks.
The staff is really nice, but kind of slow at this location. Î¾I asked what type of sauce they had and the cashier looked at me like she saw a ghost. Î¾I am not that pale! Î¾All I wanted (well not really) were some chicken nuggets to feed to my starving kids. Î¾If I had passed somewhere else with a drive thru, I would have gone there, but this was my only option. Î¾When I pulled up to get my 20 count, I was handed a small bag with a small fry. Î¾I asked the guy why he was handing it to me and he said "Because this is what you ordered." Î¾Really? Î¾I showed him my receipt and he said "Well, who's fries are these then?"I finally got the nasty tasting nuggets and some high fructose corn syrup aka dipping sauce and was on my way. Î¾I think we will stick to the meatless cheeseburgers next time.
Oh my goodness. I should have read the reviews first but this McDonald is on my way so I stopped by. This is by far the dirtiest McDonald I've seen in a long time. Staff is unfriendly and obviously so bored with their job. Definitely not even place for a quick meal!
The service at this McDonald's is so bad it's almost comical. Case in point: There was about a two week stretch where I would go to McDonald's every morning before work to get an iced vanilla latte. EVERY day (I kid you not) they got my order wrong and made me a hot latte instead. This would not be a problem, but they questioned me every time if I was sure that was what I ordered. Yes, it even showed it on your fancy digital menu. Then they would ask me to pull up and wait 10 minutes for my order to be corrected. My bf and I went inside once to order and they got his order wrong. The woman just stood there and looked at us when we told her and my bf was like, "...but I guess I can eat this". Later when we went up and asked for sauce, she gave us the biggest eyeroll upon seeing us and acted like it was physically painful for her to serve us. These are only a couple of examples of the horrible service we have had, but I guess that's typical for a McDonald's attached to a gas station.
I'm hooked on the McDonald's Oatmeal!When I want to grab some breakfast that's yummy, healthy, and easy to eat while I'm driving I head here. I'm always met with friendly service at the drive-through. They move pretty quickly and always get my order correct no matter how busy they are!
Awful! I once waited 30 minutes for a small Iced vanilla coffee. It was unbelievable, myself and several other customers were shocked at how slow they were to make simple food, there's nothing fancy about McDonald's so why it took so long is beyond me. They are always slow at this location, it doesn't matter if you do drive thru walk in. On another occasion I did the drive thru and got a burger and 2 apple pies. I ate one pie that had something hard and plastic like in it. I'm definitely sure it wasn't apple or pie crust, so disgusting. I won't ever come here again, McDonald's just keeps getting worse.
Very unhappy. Î¾I ordered a fish combo on October 3rd. Î¾When the drive through person attempted to hand me my meal she stated it was a QT. Î¾I don't eat beef and didn't order that, however I had already paid for my meal with my card. The QT was more than my fish meal so I was told they would refund me the QT and they charged me for the fish meal. Î¾Have been checking bank account all weekend no refund. Went back to the store and spoke to manager Starla who told me refunds can take up to two days to go through. It's Tuesday Oct 7th! My payment went through yesterday for two meals purchased Oct 3rd, one of which I didn't eat or take with me. Not happy. Starla tried to make the excuse that yesterday Oct 6th was a holiday. Î¾I said "what holiday" she says Columbus day. I never had respect for that man but do recognize his holiday is on the 13th for my bank so I informed Starla that yesterday was not a bank holiday. She wouldn't call the GM this evening stating the GM (General Manager) would be there tomorrow between 9to5. Î¾I'm working then too so it's a big inconvenience taking time from my job to get them to do their job. Î¾I'm really not happy with this McDonalds. Need to train their staff to be careful with peoples money. I want my money back and if I don't get it I will go to every place that I use to rate businesses and really make known my disapproval of how they do business.
I have to say, this McDonald's sucks. Don't get me wrong, I love McDonald's... But this particular location has some of the worst employees in fast food.
Never thought I would write a review about McDonalds however I went through there very early in the a.m. and just like their commercial said they were all smiles. Î¾It was nice to see some cheerfulness so early...Plus the Sausage Egg McGriddles rock!
This location has the new strawberry creme pies. The healthscore is a 93 as of 3/26/12.The drive thru cashier was really nice, but my fries were far too crispy too be any good.
Awful! Î¾ Why install the equipment to display drive thru orders to guest when it's never used. Î¾ Why have an automated person tell you to order when no is ever listening and you always have to repeat orders. Î¾ Whoever built that place wasted a ton of money on technology and did a lousy job training them to use it. Î¾ Drive to one on 78 it's much better. Î¾Grayson Hwy is the absolute best for breakfast! Î¾ I go the long way to work just to stop there!The new one has issues!
I used to stop at this McDonalds now and then on my way to work for breakfast. My main problem is that the drive thru seems to be slow at this one. And then one day, some yahoo working the drivethru charged me like 1.79 for a tea that I knew darn well was only supposed to be $1. He claimed they stopped the promotion. Well, guess what? The next day and the day after I heard the same ole advertisements I have been hearing for years now pitching their any tea or soft drink for $1. Yeah, I won't be back. Burger king has better $1 sausage breakfast burritos anyhow.
I don't go here often because the service is so bad! I have never left with the right order or sat in line less than 15 mins. They are now running this special where they give you a 1 min timer & if you don't get your order by the end of the min you get your meal free. But IT DOESNT COUNT IF THEY GIVE YOU WRONG ORDER! yep, they gave me 4 nuggets (in a 10 nugget box) & a coke when I ordered a burger & hi-c!! Smh They need 3 windows - one to pay , one to pick up & the last to return the wrong order & pick up the correct one!!
Dirty - dirty & Î¾dirty. The Resturant was so dirty that there was no clean table available. Î¾This is a fairly new location, so I'm not sure why it's not being better maintained . Hope somebody helps the staff at this location get it together.
Brand new and sparkling clean with a very modern feel, not sure how long the lime green walls will last, they are bright!!! Service was decent and the food was ok, it's still McDonalds, but they seem to be trying to carry more 'healthy' alternatives.
Getting little miss some ice cream since she had a great day at school. She loves the sundae with m&ms. Staff was super sweet and efficient which is surprising for this particular location. Maybe management finally took everyone's complaints seriously.
Unbelievably slow at drive thru. Slow to take your order, slow in taking your money, slow in filling your order. Î¾It's torture especially when you need to be somewhere and your child is hungry. DONT GO FOR BREAKFAST there's always a line of 10 cars at the drive thru window. Î¾It's no faster if you go in and order. Actually it was longer ordering inside instead of drive thru. Î¾Ughhhhh
This is the slowest mcdonalds I have ever been too. It tools between 5-10 minutes to get your food inside, and at least 5 minutes for drive through. Ever since they have opened, they have always been slow.
Rita A's review is dead on. I stop here on occasion and they cannot get anything right. If I order a shake, the shake machine is "down". Ask for no ketchup on my sandwich? Make that extra ketchup, no mustard. Light ice? Load the cup to the top!Getting my order wrong 50% of the time aside, the service is also frequently unfriendly or distracted and almost always painfully slow.I'd rather skip it and go somewhere that can get my order right and do it with a smile.
Well I guess the saying is true....you get what you pay for. They forgot to put cheese on my breakfast sandwich....though its frustrating....this IS mcdonalds...no one should ever expect more out of them. At least my caramel mocha was good.
Ice cream machine is always down, staff is rude and ghetto, food is always old. Hate this McDonalds. I always try to avoid it and go to a different one.
I had an okay visit. They kept the inside line moving and the food came out quickly and was correct. These days that's saying a lot. The staff could be a bit more friendly and better trained. The girl had trouble finding my drink on the cash register, no big deal really. This is a very busy location in the morning but it works. 3 star seems accurate for this McDonald's.
Saw roaches while eating. Told management and they reacted like its nothing new. Never again will I go to that McDonald' s even though it's close by me.
It's McDonalds...what more can I say? They haven't pissed me off nor done anything to wow me yet, so 3 stars will suffice.
Very rude staff. Î¾The food is typical McDonalds food: bad. Î¾Head for the Chick-fl-A across the street.
This McDonald's is located right next to the building which houses Studio Movie Grill. Î¾It's super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you don't want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater. Î¾But that's pretty much where the pros of this location stop.I've been to this McDonald's several times, but I've been a bit disappointed on several occasions. Î¾Most recently, I went through the drive-thru and got a simple order - a McChicken sandwich and small fries. Î¾I drove to the Studio Movie Grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fries were cold. Î¾UGHHHHH... Î¾Cold McDonald's fries are the worst. Î¾Lame!!!The employees seem to be pretty friendly, and the restaurant looks decent inside. Unfortunately, they lack power outlets (I saw one, but maybe there's a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant). Î¾This makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by McDonald's to use their laptops, which I do quite often.Overall, this McDonald's deserves about 2.5 stars because it's right in between "meh" and "A-OK." Î¾I know some may say it's "just a McDonald's," but hey - I've been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent (don't serve COLD fries!) and there are numerous power outlets for customers' use. Î¾I'll probably be back just because it's right next to Studio Movie Grill, but I'm hoping they'll start improving the quality of their fast food - at least to the McDonald's standard.[Review 076 of 366]
I've only been to this McDonald's twice and both times were bad experiences. Not only does the place smell of dirty rags and cleaner solutions, but the service is bad as well. I guess the convenient location is what keeps this place open but for me, I'll never come back.
this is CLEARLY a franchise location, and they.do.not.care. This place is a cash cow. The staff is totally random (have had some decent service, and times I would be better going to the overpriced gas station next door).Clearly the new/bigger menu has the staff utterly overwhelmed. (oh, when a place has "NOW HIRING ALL SHIFTS" signs up for ever...be warned.... there is one elderly latina lady at the drive thru whose 'here you go hun' and smile could melt and iceberg- what a joy! but...once had horrible service- complained and got an out of date coupon for one small sandwich, fries, and drink. really?
This is a BUSY location!! We stopped for lunch on a Saturday and waited forever to place our order. The play area is outside and not for toddlers. I wish they had other activities for little guys, as my son was to small to go inside the area.
My poor wife, stepdaughter and her THREE Johns Creek junior lacrosse Gladiator teammates who spent the night Saturday and were CRAVING Mickey D's this morning. Second week in a row ma's been screwed by this franchise store 10131. It's just so close to us and the kids really wanted it. Yeah, yeah - "fool me once." And I even said "now honey, be SURE to check the bag for everything before you drive away since these same folks screwed us on Easter morning en route to church."But that's tough to do - nearly impossible - with a car full of tweens and on busy Holcomb Bridge Road en route to Barnwell with three big bags stuffed with $45 worth of McD's decadence. Î¾Imagine three bags stuffed full of food - all in individual wrappers and some almost too hot to handle. But why should we even have to check behind these folks fully expecting our orders have been satisfied. Î¾You get what you pay for, right? NOT at this franchise store. At least on this blustery but sunny Sunday morning ma got a receipt. Three sandwiches missing this time totaling $6; last week's tally was about the same. What's worse is you have no recourse because the franchise's contact number on the receipt goes straight to fax. No really. See for yourselves: 770-998-7710. Diabolical strategy to be sure. We're not even fast food fans by any stretch. Especially after watching Morgan Spurlock's 'Super Size Me' a few years back. BLECH! en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuŠ—_And truth be told, if the adjacent Chick-fil-a was open on Sunday that would be our first choice. But it's not. And now we're left with no choice for Sunday morning brekky on the go because we're NEVER, EV-URH Î¾going back to this McDonald's. Hey, but don't you know people talk. Especially here in Johns Creek. All of our adjacent neighborhoods and sports teams have monthly news letters and social media sites. Highly active I might add....So you can bet the balance of our missing orders that what's happened to us will not happen to our friends and neighbors - unless they let it.
I admit, I'm not a big fan of McDonald's. However, sometimes, nothing hits the spot like their fries and a Diet Coke. What pushes this location over the edge of some others is the staff. They're always super nice whether it's 10am or 10pm. They don't make you repeat your order 18 times and they get it right. They're also generous with the condiments when you ask for them (and even when you don't!). Unlike some fast food places that stop serving milkshakes after a certain hour because they've already cleaned the machine, they'll make you a milkshake up until they close. Service is a huge thing for me so the fact that they're always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what makes me partial to this particular location. It can be a bit of a pain to get into and out of as it's right on Holcomb Bridge Rd, but that's a minor annoyance.
Only the fact that its a McDonald's is what earns it a 2.5 star. Î¾The staff at this location can vary from customer service focused to blatant disregard about anything other than accepting your food order and taking your payment. My last visit was a combination of the two, when I placed my order an the drive thru intercom, the order was taken correctly, total given, thanked and asked to drive around to the window. By the time I got around to the window, the person that was to take my money and give me my food was way more interested in an argument that was going on outside in the parking lot between two young ladies and the two young men they were with.I'll admit that I too paid attention to the fight in the parking lot to make sure it didn't escalate into gunfire with my car sitting center mass of it all. About six months ago, someone told me they got robbed while sitting in the drive thru at this location, but they were there around 2am and my visit was taking place at 6pm, so I wasn't worried about getting robbed as much as I was about getting shot.After making sure that the parking lot was not about to be shot up, he accepted my cash, asked me if I wanted to wait a minuite and get some hot fries. Î¾I did, and I did.Sure I'll go back. Î¾I love McDonald's fries. 18 of 100
Of course this is a fast food restaurant so of course there's not much of a spectacular review that I can write but I will express my concerns. I work late nights and when I do get off work if there nothing ready in the house I will stop and my only option is McDonalds or Checkers. Needless to say this is nothing short of "ghetto". I could hear the employees in the background laughing and playing over the intercom as I'm ordering the food. After I ordered, she didn't even bother to tell me my total or go over my order with me. Î¾When I made it to the window she was having a conversation with her co worker despite me having my hand out the window to give her the money. When I drove up to the second window....someone had been smoking a cigarette and threw it right outside the drive-through window. Now I don't know if it was maybe a previous customer or and employee but nobody was in front of me when I pulled up but hard to say. I could hear the music they were playing over my radio in the car and to top it off. Somebody was calling another chick a "B*tch" and just being loud. I mean hey, didn't expect nothing spectacular but if these are the people thats making my Big Mac, I'll pass. The day shift is the complete opposite so don't be discouraged too much by this. My food tasted McDonalds worthy but they need to change up that scenery a bit.
This McDonald's has the slowest drive-thru service I've ever experienced. Once or twice, we've even gotten out of line and left because it was so bad. I really don't know what their problem is. It's bad every single time I've been there, despite the hour, despite the number of cars in line...There are two reasons why I continue to return to this McD's. The first is it's convenient location. The second: my food is always hot and prepared correctly. Despite the ridiculously slow line, I've never received cold fries or a wrong order. I'm not sure what they're doing back there to make things run so agonizingly slowly, but my food always comes out fine.
No stars is more appropriate. Every time I come here, they screw something up. Today I ordered a filet light sauce and an unsweet tea. I get to work and what do I find? A filet on a TOASTED bun and some god awful flavored unsweet tea. I tried calling them today and after other experiences and they NEVER pick up their phone. I usually go through the drive-thru because it's convenient. I went into the store and found this place to be a PIG STY.
Hot Tip!If you have to go to this location in the mornings, lunch hour or evenings, it is invariable that the Jimmy Carter Blvd and Peachtree Industrial intersection just west of this McDonalds backs up past the entrance to McDonalds..."SO"Rather than taking your life in your hands by trying to turn left through three lanes of traffic, simply drive 1,200 feet pass this McDonalds and turn left at the traffic light. Then travel back through the parking lot to your get your Mc-Grub without inconveniencing all the people in cars trying to get to work or home.This advice makes much more sense than the numbskulls trying to cut through solid traffic just to get some fast food. And for you people who chose to live in "hidden cove" next to, and east of, McDonalds... you have no luck in being able to pull out easily. The traffic is always solid in front of that entrance/exit and you really should have chosen another place to live with easy egress. I know a clue is a lot to ask for these days.
Stopped off at this location around 6:45 am on a weekday, and had to be to work by 7am. Î¾Getting to this place can be a hassle because of where my work is located. Î¾However, I stopped because they had that 2 Sausage Egg McMuffins for $3. Î¾I wanted to get some for my team. Î¾Got to the drive-thru and told the lady what I wanted, which was the Î¾2 Sausage Egg McMuffin special. Î¾She said, "we're out of sausage!" Î¾Naturally I questioned her again, but it was true, this McDonalds was out of sausages. Î¾I simply drove off.It was a hassle to get there and on top of that they ran out of a product they were advertising. Î¾Let's just say I won't be taking the extra effort to visit that location.
in consistent Quality! Late Nights the food is bad, but during busy hours its good!
I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a fan of fast food. But this mcdonalds is always slow. And the freshness of the food is hit or miss. I also feel like it's one of the few mcds that hasn't been remodeled to the newer design.
Went here 3 times over the course of a couple weeks. The first 2 times they got my order wrong, and on the 3rd, my wife found a Bic pen blended up in her smoothie. I'm not even sure how that can accidentally happen. We emailed the owner to complain, and when he called us back he had quite an attitude and was unapologetic about the incident. All he did was defend their food inspection rating.
Ok I'm waiting for like 10 minutes to place my order with the staff walking back & forth just looking at me like I'm crazy. And another 10 minutes or so before i got my food, This location use to be my stop in the mornings when I worked near here but they have fallen way off.
It is what it is... so I'm mclovin' it.
I live slightly closer to this McDonalds than the One next to Perimeter Mall. Î¾Even though the McDonalds next to Perimeter Mall is farther away and always has traffic around it I pick it over this location. Î¾It's old and dirty and has a monopoly for fast food in this area. Î¾If it wasn't a McDonalds, it would fail. Î¾It's actually a testament to how strong the McDonalds name is. Î¾This location is awful!
They have signs posted telling you that you are only allowed 30 minutes to consume your food and then you must vacate... that seems a bit pushy.
If I could give this place zero stars I would !!! They do not train staff in guest service and the management is horrible . When I am not near a Starbucks I like to come here sometimes for their iced coffee, they have never got my order right and never been compelled to fix my order or give me a refund . One day me and hubby were in a rush in the morning and grabbed " breakfast " when we got Into the car we look inside of our bag and we have all lunch items. We go back inside to correct our order and we are informed that breakfast is over and there is nothing they can do. They proceeded to take our name down and told us we could grab free breakfast the next day. Next morning comes around and we go to get our breakfast. We are told that our names are not in the book and again there's nothing they can do !? I mean it's mcdonalds but please have some pride in what you do!?
Always come here with no expectations in my food and somehow it exceeds to be lowered when I receive my food.Tip! Always ask for ketchup and ketchup cause they'll never throw any in the bag.But, it's McDonald's and all are the same.
I just ordered food from there an hour ago. My fries were all stale and cold. They must have been old. They forgot to give me my drink. I've been trying to call them and their phones are busy. Worst McDonald's I have ever been too. I tried to be nice yesterday and compliment them since it was Christmas but I feel like it was a mistake.
They can't get the orders right. Î¾I always have to double check my bag before leaving the drive thru. They're open late, but they have no lights on at night. Poor service. I'd rather go to Sonic's down the street. Î¾This Mc Donald's needs improvement. Î¾Bad
Worst McDonald's ever bad costumer service cold burgers cold fries the manager lady is the biggest B**** I have meet, Î¾the people that work there are slow and dumb I think I rather drive out of my way than come here.
Went there just to get coffee in the morning and the one thing I need in the morning COFFEE was apparently out of order.
I stopped at this McDonald's because I had about two minutes to grab lunch. The ONLY reason I ever eat at a Mickey D's is because it's a) fast, b) cheap and c) predictable. You know the food won't be awesome, but it will be reasonably eatable. Man, was I disappointed on points b) and c).First, the medium Quarter Pounder meal was more than six bucks. Jeez, that's hardly a deal.What made the sticker shock worse was the poor quality of the food. This had to be the worst Quarter Pounder I've ever (half) eaten. Maybe even the worst fast food burger I've ever had. It looked like it had been sitting out on Uncle Zeke's radiator all morning. The burger patties were gray and curled up at the edges. The bun was dry and crusty. It's like the damn thing was somehow mummified. Just nasty. Too bad I didn't have time to take it back.This will probably be the very last time I ever eat at a McDonald's. It was that bad.
The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said "please" and "thank you." And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9. What in the fucking fuck..... Fuck that McDonalds.
Worst McDonalds EVER!!!!!!!!!! They are unable to get an order correct, Went through the drive through last night got home and no Fries in my bag. Got to the window and the woman running the window was talking about her personal life with a co worker laughing it up with her back t us making us wait instead of giving us our ice coffee. Then she seemed to remember she was working and brought us our coffee. Last time I went there I ordered something with no mayo which my tix said... got home and covered in mayo. called up to complain and the response...What do u want me to do about it??? If I get the craving for Mcdonald's I will drive out of my way.. I hope this one goes out of business.... Î¾This location is good for nothing

Î¾I hope this one goes out of business.... Î¾This location is good for nothing, my husband and I if we ever go to another mcdonalds, it will be out of state!
Management is very rude here, I bring my son every now and then to play Î¾and have witnessed on several occasions the manager who is a female was extremley rude. I was shocked at her behavior. I still go there because its close to my house.
Worst one I've eve been too! I was number 205 and I waited for ever and ever, and the manager was giving out the food and saw me standing there forever and she didn't ask me what my order was or anything. It got up to 216 when the cashier had to ask me what my order was. So slow and disorganized and barely any space to eat and sit down.
I stopped by for a quick lunch and it took twenty minutes to get my order and was only spoken to in Spanish
My mom and I went here for sodas around the night I moved back, they tasted normal. My husband and I got sodas this morning and I cant even describe how awful they tasted! We promptly threw them out and went somewhere else. On top of that the panhandlers and drug addicts asking for money (both times) is ridiculous. Plus, we could barely understand the lady talking through the order box in the drive through.Don't go here!
We are retired and have gone to this McDonald's since they built it two blocks from our house. Î¾This last year it has gone down hill. Î¾They are out of things often, week after week. Î¾The service has become poor. Î¾Some of the long time employees are good but the bad now outweighs the good at that location.The street people hitting you up in the drive through and inside but the managers will do nothing about them. Î¾Talked to the owner and he said he would see thing get better but they did not. After all these years we decided we no longer need McDonald's and have not been in three months. Î¾We have ten grandkids that are not missing it either. Î¾Poor service has cost them a lot when you think about it over the years.
Agree, worst McDonalds ever. Not only did they mess up our order, they messed up the order before ours.
Worst McDonalds in Vegas! Bad service consistently and sloppy made food. 3 trys and still crap. WTF! I am sure the hobo's panhandling outside could do better. They seriously must go out of the way to fuck things up. I just want to know what other McDonalds this Franchisee owns so I can avoid those also.
Horrible Service- to the extent that I had to come on and write about a mcdonalds... Lol
I went to get some food for my wife and I at 11pm. This place is in a hotel so you think they would have staffing. Nope! They had 2 people working and were running out of food as they were taking orders. No planning ahead here. There were almost 20 people in line and took over half an hour to get my food. It was ridiculous.
This place is quite sub par, even for a McDonald's. Î¾This place is really ghetto, and there's always a bunch of annoying kids loitering and taking up the available tables. Î¾I guess it's OK if you want to grab a soda on a hot day or a snack to munch on while walking around, but again, it's not very good... for your health or for taste. Î¾I say, exert some self-discipline, buy something worthwhile in Walmart's grocery section, then go home and prepare something worth eating.
I was on my way home a little after midnight and I wanted a cold drink. Î¾This McDonald's is easy to get to. Î¾The drive through had three cars in front of me but before long, I had my diet Coke ordered and I was soon at the window picking it up.I generally don't stop in this neighborhood because there are others closer to home, but this was perfect last night. Î¾A good stop with a pleasant and quick staff.
Ordered at 3:55am on 9/21. Did not get food until 4:07am. They forgot our order of fries. I had to call twice and they hung up on me both times without an update. Third time I called they said they were waiting for the eggs to cook. 4:10am received order of fries.
By far the worst drive thru experience in the United States. My husband & I stopped by for drinks (since it was a hot evening during our visit in Vegas). A tall, large African American man was working the drive thru. When we ordered he never responded over the speaker after waiting 3 minutes. We finally pulled up to the window & the car in front of us entire order was wrong. They had to pull up front & wait. When we made it to the window he asked us "did you order?" & we confirmed yes "he asked what it was". Once we told him what our order was he said "for real ". I was floored at the TERRIBLE service of this chain. The service was so bad I took a photo of the phone number posted outside the window to file a complaint. After he confirmed our order (which was only two drinks) we waited at that window another 5 minutes to get the drinks. When we drove off we noticed it was a slu of cars waiting behind us.The guy working the window CLEARLY did not know what he was doing & shouldn't have been working the drive thru. The owner of this franchise really needs to put some TLC & training into their staff.
Drive thru SUCKS here!!!! This is the 3rd time they messed up my order and there sooooo freakin slow! They have no since of urgency.
What do you expect? It's a McDonalds. You go here for bad coffee and even worse food. I usually get annoyed when I receive poor service, but I should temper the urge to write about it based on the location and the service they are providing. If you want better service and/or better food, go to a Starbuck and spend a few more pennies. This is just an average run-of-the-mill McDonalds.
Fries were old and cold...they were out of ice. Asked for the sandwich to be plain, it did not come that way. They forgot to give us our drinks.
This location is quite busy. Had a good deal on Big Mac's. Quick and easy food to pick up for the kids on the go ...
Only 2 reviews for a McDonalds, hmmm...make it 3!Let's just say, not the best. Î¾I've been 4+ times to this location. Î¾3 of the 4 times, they had my order wrong. Î¾Once, when ordering chicken mcnuggets via the Drive-thru, they asked me to pull around the corner and park...and they would bring it out to me. Î¾I waited 20 minutes! Î¾On a positive note, if you order and decide to eat there, the inside is actually pretty big and kept clean. Î¾It's also offstrip and has easy parking. Î¾P.S. In-and-Out is just one more block up the street!
The story is short: Evil, Dishonest Scam artists and bigots.The story is LONG:There are a number of things wrong with this McDonalds, but a few things that are right. Let's start with ...The Good:Food is usually correct as ordered in the drive-thru.Workers are friendly enough (probably because they see me often).The Bad:On the drive-thru menu board, it SAYS PLAINLY: Value Meal #2 (Quarter Pounder w/ cheese) $5.09 for medium fries/drink, large fries and large drink for $0.40 extra. Total should be $5.49 plus tax.I say PLAINLY at least a dozen times a month: "Number 2 LARGE with COKE!".My receipt SAYS PLAINLY: 1 QRT CHEESE ML-LRG $3.80 1 XLG COKE 1.89. Subtotal $5.69 TAKE OUT TAX 0.45.WTF is a TAKE OUT TAX? We're quibbling over 20 cents plus a dubious "TAKE OUT TAX" but it's twenty cents for 30 customers an hour times 18 hours a day times 365 days a year. SCAM ARTISTS RUNNING THIS MCDONALDS! BOO! HISS!The Ugly:Only people of one race and one sex are hired at this restaurant (and apparently only one national origin, too). Î¾This is against Federal law (see eeoc.gov ) When a population of workers is examined as to characteristics such as gender, race, and age, and the data is charted according to statistical groupings, and you wind up with everybody being the same, this is a pattern that is against Federal law. But, who cares, it's Vegas, and it's McDonalds in Vegas, right? I emailed McDonalds corporate and they couldn't care less. The response I got back was a form letter copy/pasted.
WTF! This place sucks! Just left drive thru...was in line for 25 min! Girl got my order wrong took back extra soda...gave me my order and disappeared for 5 min while I waited for receipt. When I finally got my receipt I was so mad I drove off only to find out I still got charged for the soda! Wow really mc d's? She was so lazy she bet on me leaving so she didnt have to give me my $1 refund. Jokes on me. One less family that will go here so sad
Nice McDonald's inside, but they have a remote that locks the bathroom. Ghetto much?
Simple question, what is so hard about making a dipped cone, that looks like the picture in the restaurant. Î¾Sometimes they make it so fat, that it attacks my clothing.I love your dipped cones. Î¾Addicted to it.
It's mcdonalds for F@&S sake. It is what it is. The food sucks but it is usually microwaved or fried within a (debatable) somewhat reasonable amt. of time. Staff are usually genuinely unhappy, but nice none the less.
Here I sit. 25 minutes now waiting for my 5 breakfast burritos. This McDonald's is slow and the employees are not at all friendly. I do not recommend this place at all.
Worst McDonalds Ever! Î¾I work close so it is convenient for breakfast and lunch, however, after my experience today, I will not be going back. Î¾With so many other dining options in the area, I wonder why they don't pay attention to the reviews and step up their game. Î¾Today, I went through the drive thru - which is always the slowest around (average of about 5 mins in line - longest time was 11 minutes). Î¾Today was the 4th time in a month that I've been through the drive thru and my order was wrong or incomplete. Î¾I'm only one person, how many other people does this happen to.This morning, I went to the drive thru about 6:10am, lucky since I was the only one in line. Î¾Placed my order, but could tell the person taking my order was distracted. Î¾Got to the payment window, where the person dropped my change on the ground, ugh. Î¾Next window, pick up food. Î¾Here is the entire conversation: Me: Î¾Can I get some Mayonnaise and Salt? MD's: Î¾Mayonnaise? Î¾(as he is chatting with a co-worker and not listening to me.Me: Yes, Mayonnaise and Salt.MD's: OK. Î¾(Still chatting it up with co-worker)MD's: Î¾That was Mayonnaise and Jelly?Me: No. Î¾Mayonnaise and Salt.UGH!! Î¾Pay attention! Î¾Needless to say, I got to work and order was incomplete. Î¾Frustrated, I got back in my car, drove back to restaurant and went inside. Î¾Talked to a manager or assistant (couldn't tell, as they had no nametag), but they were very uninterested in the fact that a customer had an issue. Î¾I explained that it had happened 4 times in last month, still no reaction. Î¾No concern, NO APOLOGY. Î¾ Î¾He proceeded to get my other item, but was not going to replace the current one I brought back. Î¾Since it was now a cold item, I had to ask to get a replacement.I mentioned again that this is the 4th time in a month that this had happened to just me, but again, no apology, no concern, and no reaction. Î¾Worst customer service of any restaurant I've ever been in. Î¾It seems to me that they need to be reading these reviews and try to improve. Î¾I will be sending a copy of this review to McDonald's corporate office, because if they are not already aware of how bad this store is, they need to be.
This McD's is bad. It is near my home and has a drive thru so I hit it up for the dollar menu. It is pure convenience that I go to this one. The wait for food here is unreal. this last week my mcdouble tasted more like it was reheated. The bun was rock hard :(I just never know if I'm going to get what I ordered correctly or if it will taste normal or reheated. I have been getting coupon books in the mail that have been good deals. Inside feels kinda cramped. The lines inside are as bad as the drive thru. Please remember that people leaving the drive thru have rights too. I obey the stop sign before pulling out but it seems the people shopping within the strip mall think they have the right to zip by you and not let you out.
I'm so relieved I'm not the only one who knows how dysfunctional this McDonalds is compared to any other. Î¾Every time I'd be in the drive-thru they'd get my order wrong, and as I waited for my upcoming wrong order with cars in front of me, I entertained myself by (1) watching Î¾the hand-off of food from the employee Î¾to the driver of the car; (2) a slight pause; and (3) Î¾then the hand back as the driver QA's and returns the wrong order that was given to them. Î¾I hope this McDonald's improves because I'm sure there are some good employees who work here and this is such a great location for this restaurant.
Don't come in. Their priority is the drive thru. Don't waste your time. Horrible customer service. I will be avoiding this place as much as possible.
The drive- thru might be the worst. Î¾I've gone through a few times. Î¾The staff is rude and when they short your order your made to feel like it's your fault .
I dont mind fresh and hot...but when you have to wait 15 minutes to order and another 15 minutes to receive the order plus bad attitude....not a good mixTry two cashiers when you got 4 people or more in one line...that would cut the first 15 minutes
Flavorless cardboard and meat like substance.., Î¾ Unfit for human consumption !!! Î¾ Î¾ Î¾I gave irvine last try and it's worse than ever
This is the only burger place within 5 minutes of my office so I've been going here to pick up my lunch before starting work. However, this morning I get there at 10:25 because i have to be at work at 10:35. I try to order a chicken wrap and I'm told they can't take lunch orders until 10:30. Now up until recently I worked in the food industry for 14 years as a manager and I understand the reason for these time frames for breakfast and lunch, but at 5 minutes till I can get a wrap so I can make it to my office with lunch on time? I asked the order taker if they could please help me out it was only 5 minutes and they flat out refused. OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS!! Won't be going back. There is a Vons, a Port of Subs, a Panda Express, an Ensteins Bagels, 2 Pizza Places, and a couple of other restraunts all in the same shopping center so just keep pushing business away to your competitors.Monday June 9, 2014 10:45 am
This is hands down the WORST McD's location.I keep saying I wont go back but I think what keeps me going back is that living in the heart of Summerlin there isn't much of an option besides the Burger King on Town Center.The drive-thru is always so so so long and the workers at the window are so slow and seem like it is their first day every time. My order is NEVER right! I order a McGriddle and get a McMuffin WTH! The food is either overcooked or not accurate. What is with the coke? It always and I mean always tastes weird.I have sent an e-mail through the website complaining and they said since nobody else complained about the coke it must be fine. WRONG! If you get the nasty coke please send them an e-mail if enough people complain they might actually do something!!I usually go to the location on Charleston but since this one is so close I do still come here when I have coupons but I make sure and go inside where I can verify my order.
I don't know what it is about this McDonald's. It's like kids run the joint. Not that they aren't friendly, but too many of them just aren't professional, and seem to think the customers are part of their entertainment. This job is basically an extension to their social life. Î¾It's a problem.
Service is terribly slow. Orders have never been correct. Manager Oscar is trained in a third world country. I have boycotted this location for the last year and I live and work within walking distance of this place. I'd much rather go out of my way and give my money to the Boca Park location.
This was the worst Mcdonalds in all of Las Vegas. Î¾My daughter wanted a breakfast burrito and I needed a coffee. 1 car in front in of me and 23 minutes stuck in the drive thru. WHO's the manager? I didnt see one person that was capable of being in charge of running that place. Next tiem I decide to go to Mcdonalds by my job I will hop on the freeway and go to another one and still return to work faster then running across the street to this one!!!!!!
Honestly McDonalds is a McDonalds but I've never been to one so slow. Went in to grab some breakfast and, although no one was there, it still took 20 min. The fact that I keep coming back is just because it is close.
Went through the Drive-thru today at about 11:15 am for lunch. Ordered the habanero quarter pounders and a caramel sundae. Sundae machine was down, so no sundae. I should have taken that as an omen and just left. Got the promo to buy a quarter pounder & get one free. When I went to eat my sandwich I had to search for the habanero sauce( just a touch was on the bun), and the burger was dry as hell and tasted like it had been reheated from the day before. I took one bite and could barely chew it. I threw them both away. What a waste of gas and time. Never going to this place again ... Î¾AWFUL
I don't know what the deal is with this location, but they are ridiculously slow! Even if my order is a pre made salad and iced coffee and there is no one else in the drive-thru lane, it still takes forever!
Don't tell anyone but I like McDonald's coffee better than Starbucks. I rather have McDonald's coffee over any other coffee in the world. This McDonald's location would have gotten 5 stars about 3 months ago, but things have changed. A few months ago, the workers were really cool, but now they have all just gotten really f*cking weird! It's almost like one of those 1980s B-Horror Movies where one of the workers gets infected with the Zombie/Vampire/Werewolf virus and then comes to work the next day and spreads it to all his coworkers. Î¾That's the only logical explanation because every worker here has transformed into McDumbasses!I want to remind you that this is Summerlin, so that means that everyone runs stop signs, no one yields for pedestrians, Î¾and everyone argues over the stupidest most insignificant things. Watch out when you are entering this drive-thru because there is a huge chance that some douchebag in a BMW will run the stop sign in order to cut in front of you.When I drove up to the box, there was no answer. About 2 minutes later I begin hearing a ton of static and then this bizarre sounding guy starts talking in this strange tone. He sounded like a drunk Orson Wells. When I pulled up to the first window to pay, the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eyes and one of those horror movie smiles. Immediately he lets out this high pitched: "reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!" noise at me. At that particular moment, due to the fear of man-rape, I thought about driving over the planters and escaping. But, he looked so weird that I came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super powers and would catch me no matter how fast I drove, so I just sat there and awaited my fate. After about 2-3 seconds he told me how much my coffee cost in a disturbingly soft tone voice, and thankfully he didn't serve me McRape. Î¾When I drove up to the pick-up window, I was greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who didn't even give me eye contact, and while holding the coffee he sticks his arm out the window and just drops it before I even have the chance to reach out to grab it. It was a miracle that I caught the thing in mid air. Î¾I was glad to get the McF*ck out of there.
Awful service and extremely slow. Go elsewhere.
I love Mcdonalds, grew up on it and still take my boys there regularly and I have to say this. Î¾The location off of the circle in Summerlin really has some hard times keeping up. Î¾The place always seems to be a bit dirty both in the lobby and behind the counter. Î¾I dread getting a "quick" bite with the boys when we are in a hurry as they are never fast in the drive thru!! Î¾BUT the food is always just as good at any other Mcdonalds, so they do have that going for them!! Î¾It is literally though one of the slowest mickey D's I have ever been to. Î¾And this is not just one experience, I go very regularly because as I said I love it and this one is the closest to me, so for convenience, but sometimes I wonder if it would be faster to drive seven minutes out of my way to another mcdonalds....Their Employees are so nice though, just not the best on the speed side of things!Maybe they will get better!
I've never tried a McRib Sandwich and I heard via the Talk Threads that McDonald's in Las Vegas started serving them the other day, so I took my Son here to give this legendary Sandwich a try.We ordered two McRib Meals (Sandwich, Fries, Soda) $4.19. Î¾I also wanted to try the $1 Spicy McChicken Sandwich.The verdict......I didn't like the McRib at all...blech! Î¾The Sauce was the best part about it. Other than that, it was pretty bland. Î¾The Fries were good of course....and the Spicy McChicken Sandwich was decent, not bad for $1.Overall, it was a complete waste of calories. Î¾I'm not dinging McDonald's for my stupid curiosity, so they get 3 Stars. Î¾The McDonald's experience was A-OK. Did I find value in my meal? Î¾Not today....my fault though.Will I return? Î¾I'd come back again to order something I enjoy.
Pretty good service for fast food.
The drive through line is terrible. They are painfully slow.
This has to be the WORST McDonalds within a 3,000 mile radius. The staff are young, rude, untrained kids from the local middle school and the drive-through is really painfull. This location should be closed down or sold to someone who knows how to run a McDonalds. They're always out of something, there's never a cashier in the first drive- through window (where your supposed to pay) so people sit in their cars and wait for a cashier to magically appear to take their money..not happening! So then you decide to walk in to order thinking you'll get your order faster and not missing something..WRONG! As you stand there and wait for them to make and bag your order your watching the car that would have been behind you, in the drive-through, leave. WTF! Next time, I'm getting Mexican food!
Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. I highly do not recommend this location. Hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me! -Sarah (This was written by Paul's wife because I am usually the one dealing with them. I guess he got smarter.)
My drive through experience was a pleasant one. The workers seemed very friendly and I received quick service. Whenever I go to drive thrus I'm not usually asked how my day is going unless I'm at Starbucks. I didn't feel like I was rushed and the most important thing is they didn't forget the sweet and sour sauce!
Avoid the drive through in the evenings.Food takes too long, the people taking orders and at the window are not professional at all.If I do plan on going to this McDonalds at night, I always have a better experience walking in.
So horrible no matter what time of day it is, you'll always get food that has been prepared so messy.
very nice and clean. i came here late night and it was the only mcD's open in the area i think. came for the sweet tea.. and they had no more!
thinking lightening (and back luck) couldn't possibly strike twice, i returned to mcdonald's in summerlin to place a small order (not 10 mcmuffins as the morning before) for me & the posse who got called into work on a sunday. Î¾this time i opt to go thru the drive-thru coz nobody's in line. Î¾wow, it's looking good... or so i thought. Î¾paid for my simple order at the 1st window, then waited 10 more minutes behind the only car at the pickup window (here we go, am i gonna be later for work again with only 1 car in front of me? WTF????). Cars were honking ferociously behind me. now i'm blocked in. Î¾low and behold when i move up, i recognize the guy handing me my food as one of the mcdonald's workers who stepped over my pile of food in slow-motion matrix effect yesterday morning. Î¾ughhh! Î¾guess they're probably hiring at this fast food establishment and will take any dreggs off the street who either has a pulse or a trust fund, so what's the hurry? Î¾Gave them a 2nd chance, learned my lesson, won't ever go back. Î¾As an aside, took the time to e-mail mcdonalds and got the proverbial party line response, i.e. we pride ourselves on blah blah blah. i normally believe in redemption but not from this place.
Parking not very welcoming to large RV's, and don't park next door at the convenience station they charge to park. Staff seemed confused on how to handle special requests, choosing instead to argue with a customer in-front of me and behind me.
This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to.Yes, there ARE better McD's out there. Like the one on Boulder Highway by Joker's Wild, right before you hit Warm Springs.I have visited the last two nights here....Because I was picking up a friend of mine who got off from work, and we had a sweet tooth.....along with my family members at the house.Yesterday, we pull up and ask for hot fudge sundaes. Ice cream machine is out.Instead, we get two large sweet teas.....Which were overly sweet. Almost...gave off a syrup feel after I swallowed.Tonight, the ice cream machine IS working, so I get two sundaes, and of course, two large sweet teas.Sundaes look sad, because they are not in their proper clear plastic cup...they are instead in mini McFlurry cups....(not even filled completely, might I add.)My friend and I take one sip of our sweet teas....and they taste like dirty water.It's almost like they were trying to trick us.....Like, they didn't have enough tea, so they filled 3/4 of the cup with water.... Seriously, if I wanted the taste of unfiltered water, I would just pick up a hose out of someone's back yard. The women who work here, hate their lives. I mean, they are just wretched.One of the cars parked by the drive thru was.....vandalized with shaving cream, and what appeared to be eggs... Can't say I blame the perpitrator when these ladies can't even pour a glass of tea. .....I don't condone it, but hey, some people are crazy about their food.
Cold fries and best of all, a customer came in and ordered. The table he wanted had some kind of white creamy junk on it. He went and told someone and they handed him a rag. Lol
I wish I could give no stars. I have literally had to call so many times to complain that I've stopped because it's clear no one there give a fuck about their customers. McDonalds corp just had the owner if this location call me and all she did was question me about all the issues as if I was the one who seemed sketchy. I even told them I don't want free food just get my order right.
Update. Im sick of coming here and having them tell me after a long wait in line that theyre out of whatever im looking for. Please. After a few times i get the picture.
I do not live far from this McDonalds location so I have been here several times before. Today is Tuesday, Jan. 29th@7:04am and I placed and paid for an order of sausage w/egg biscuit and 2 hasbrowns "to go" at the drive thru. The meal was bagged and handed to me by the store mgr. at the 2nd window. When I returned home, what I found was a sausage w/egg biscuit but only 1 hashbrown. A small inconvenience but when I am unemployed and pay for a portion of a meal I did not receive...I'm sure you get the point.Trust, reliabilty...out the window. For all who read this, be sure to check your order before pulling away from the drive thru window. I won't be patronizing this location for awhile.
Employees look like they hate their job. Milkshake was like drinking milk. Food was cold and not warm at all.
Keep Driving.On this day they were only accepting cash? I wanted to order a drink at the window where I paid and she she said I couldn't? More like she wouldn't. Kids shakes were dripping and messy so when I asked for extra napkins to clean up her mess the ding-dong gives me one napkin. Then I tell them napkins were not in the bags and when I asked for more they hand me ONE napkin.This is when you give up and drive away!
Came in for breakfast and ordered a sausage egg biscuit with an iced mocha. The cashier advised me that I couldn't get a mocha, when I asked about a frappucino she said no to that too, and then mentioned that they were out of orange juice. Essentially I had the choice of getting a sweet tea or a Coke product with my breakfast sandwich and hash brown. Now that I have experienced sweet tea with a sausage egg biscuit I can say with all certainty that these two items should not be served together.This particular McDonald's does not exude any of McDonald's core philosophies such as variety or efficiency. It seems poorly stocked, poorly operated and under maintained. The bathrooms are filthy and I would suggest buying a cheap pair of socks for your child because their socks will be coated in dirt after 5 minutes of playing. The only thing that was good about my visit was my sausage egg biscuit sandwich. The hash brown tasted as though it had fried in old rancid oil. The sweet tea, while good by itself shouldn't be 1 of 2 options available during the morning since someone or something broke the McCafe machine and ran away with the orange juice.Seriously, don't go here. This is not the McDonald's you're looking for.
The worst service I've ever seen! They act like you're bothering them. I'll drive an extra couple of miles to go to another McDonald's. or just go somewhere else.
Came to this McDonald's a couple of times and tried to order a few drinks and their machine did not work for anything. No hot chocolate no hot mocha no anything. On top of that the lady in the drive thru said it hasn't worked for a couple of months. A multi million dollar company and they can't fix the machines? Î¾Wth? Not coming to this mcd again. Î¾And they are slow 10 mins to get a drink.
Terrible service! Staff was too busy chatting with each other . I left with my 2 children after waiting 5 min to place an order. I will never return to this McDonald's ! I will take my business elsewhere and recommend you do the same.
Went there on a Sunday afternoon. Î¾It was only moderately busy. But only one cashier (Jessica Carter) taking orders. She complained that kids in general in restaurant were screaming too loud and that she was too busy to accurately take our orders. Waited more than 20 minutes for our food. The order as placed on tray was incorrect. Î¾A new low in fast food...
Starts as good still serving breakfast I'm happy ok. Then the McCafe machine is broke ok screw it I'll just by Starbucks. Next order taken employees shift change and forget to make my food. All I can say is are you kidding me
I don't eat at McDonald's often, but I had a craving for their frozen lemonade drink. One worker greeted me at the door as I walked in, the cashier was very polite and everyone of the employees was actively working either completing orders or cleaning. I was kinda impressed with seeing a crew work together like they did on this visit. Not room for complaints with anything at all, kudos to the team there.
McDonald's should never disappoint, but this one certainly will as they are slow as heck and 9 times out of 10, your fries WILL be cold!
Seriously I do not know why I bother with this place other than it's the closest fast food to where I live. Î¾So many fails it's unbelievable. Î¾Burgers with no buns, wrong orders, soda without carbonation or taste. Î¾I've even gone far enough to complain to corporate. Î¾Even though they had someone call me about it they actual place didn't seem to improve. Î¾ Just skip it.
they mess up every time i go unless my order is under 3 bucks, even if its just sweet tea, its straight crappy water. Î¾i called corporate twice, they sent me a coupon which was not even the value of what they made a mistake on. Î¾my name was in the BOOK and the lady behind the counter still wanted my receipt. corporate even said i didnt need one. i understand they get jacked all the time, but dont jack your customers....its a pass
So what do you get when you are hungry...its 9AM....you only have had 3 hours sleep and you are looking for a homie who was last heard from 3 hours ago....McD's of course!!!The sausage egg McMuffin tastes like heaven when you are a bit drunk still, driving down and around the strip. At the OJ and water.....pure re-hydrating goodness!!! The take ATM/Credit at the drive thru and are speedy and attentive when taking your order.Oh BTW...the friend I was looking for...he was still in our hotel at the same craps table I left him at!!!!! I actually left the hotel cause I didn't think he would still be down there!! Gotta love Vegas!!
Worst McDonald's ever! If you're looking for customer service this is definitely not the place. Î¾How hard is it to get an order right? Or, I don't know, Î¾how hard is it to work the drive thru window and pretend to know what your doing!! Ugh
I was walking down the Strip with relatives from out of town when they commented they were thirsty. At their behest we went into this McDonald's.The line was long and ill-managed. Only one register was open despite the 30 or so people in line.Most of my companions got their soda right away. One person ordered a coffee, which took 20 minutes to receive.
Terrible service, plain and simple!
John the manager at this mcdonalds was rude and did not want to provide customer service. In the middle of ordering drive through he refused to accept order. I guess he thinks because he has flashy lights he can do as he likes. Î¾I do not recommend this Mcdonalds. Î¾Take it for what its worth. Î¾Hope you have a better experience than I did.
Just having come from a trip at the hotel across the street from this little wonder, I got to speak.Night one: About midnight I go in. There are about 5 people waiting in line. Fewer are behind the counter. The lights are on.Mister Manager announces "We close for 30 minutes! Order later!". Curious. Rude. Dismissive.Night two: The layout of the place makes for poor line control. From S. Las Vegas Blvd. won walks into a box type eating area, then for no good reason the ordering counters swing to an angle. One is challenged as to were the line is, and which line they are in.The management staff was rough with staff, and the staff seemingly part of the Clinton Welfare reform failure.People working in a McDy's on "The Strip" need a certain group of skills.The one's at this McDy's, lacked skills.
This Mcdonalds is not only in the business of making crappy food and providing even crappier service watch out for the racket they have in the parking lot . If your not careful reading the sign at the the front of the entrance it is going to cost you $195.00 in parking fees. went in to to ask the management they just blew me off. lucky they are in vegas where they dont count on repeat businesssss.
This is the most fucked up McDonald's you are gonna see. Î¾Of course I didn't buy anything in here but really like going in there to use their bathroom because it's like negative McMoney for the big McCorporationBucks.com. Î¾They have a shitty parking lot, people reading racing papers in the back, and a depressed Korean woman eating a chicken sandwich in the front. Î¾There's a big old Golden Arches out there with lights all over it, like just regular light bulb lights. Î¾The sign says "new building coming soon" and there are shitty renderings of a new fancy Dallas-style McD's with vegas lights all over it. Î¾I can certainly wait for the new sign and building because I like the old one. Î¾I went in here when I was buzzing on a Full Throttle slurpee which I highly recommend.
remember when i said I never eat at mcdonald's? Î¾I think I did. Î¾I vaguely remember a fried chicken sandwich sometime around 4am. Î¾i think i might have slept in it, which wouldn't have been too bad, since i think it was soggy anyway. Î¾drunk, vegas, and vacation are my excuses and i'm sticking to em
One star because McDonald's is not food... it's engineered matter that just happens to be edible. But I thought I'd review this McDonald's in particular. It's the last McDonald's I ever ate at. The year was 2004 and in the dark of night, in the cool spring air, my friends and I stumbled out of a casino, drunk from free beer and poor from expensive gambling. It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything. The last man was not so far gone but was the dirtiest of them all. Once our burgers were consumed, we headed out. I was glad to leave... only sleep lay before me now.
We came here the day after Christmas with our 2 kids and our nephew to quickly eat breakfast. Î¾We were greeted in a very non friendly demeanor by this older woman who just couldn't get our order right. Î¾Once we got our order, she still got it wrong and I went back and said something to her. Î¾No apologies. Î¾She would not give me the small coffee I wanted instead of the large coffee and she short changed us a sausage burrito.So, I bought another coffee, even though I should not have had to pay for it because I was in a rush. Î¾She just had a really sour attitude and I know she probably doesn't like working there, but it's not my fault. Î¾She accepted working there.So, for that, I give her a 1 star.However, the next day, we did come and the younger man was in her place and he was pretty much perfect. Î¾Got everything right. Î¾Great attitude, no issues. Î¾I give him a 5 star.
I usually don't have problems with this location even though I get irritated with their employees' attitudes sometimes. Today, however, my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there. The one worker that I absolutely dread encountering is the slightly older woman with glasses who is on the heavier side. She has the worst attitude out of all the workers there and it is clear that she hates her job. She is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right. When I drove up to the pick up window, a teenage employee was there and gave me my bag of food. I ordered two combos. I waited about 15 seconds for my drinks, and he was awkwardly standing there, wondering why I didn't drive off yet. Then he asked, "Are you waiting for something else? That should be it." I said, "...We ordered drinks too." He looks behind him and there are my drinks! "Oh!" he exclaims. As I am situating the drinks into my cup holders, I hear him say, "Here." When I turn around towards the window, half of his arm is in my car and the straws almost hit my face! WTF?! I was so irritated by his incompetency. Also, one thing that I don't like is how two drive-thru speakers are built, but the employees are always confused by which one to use. For example, I would order at the first speaker. When there is a long line, I get stuck at the second speaker and a worker tries to take my order there when I already ordered at the first one! Sometimes I tell them that I've already ordered, and sometimes I ignore them even when they're constantly asking, "Hello? Are you ready to order?"Incompetent workers and a confusing drive-thru! So annoying.
Ok We have a consistent problem with this McDonald's. Specifically with the coffee. And that's too bad because McD's coffee is typically very good. Today's problem is the decaf. Old. Very old. I'd say from late last night possibly but certainly not brewed this morning. We should have went to the coffee shop next door. Previously (& not yet posted) Almost without exception either the coffee or the service is just awful here. I started asking for cream/sugar on the side because they screw it up. Î¾The coffee is sometime cold as well.
Went here for Breakfast with my Grand daughter. She loved Î¾the play place. I ordered Î¾the bacon egg biscuit, hash browns and iced coffee for me and since they do not have happy meals at breakfast time( they really need to come up with a happy meal breakfast!) we ordered scrambled eggs and bacon for her. My biscuit was very dry and the hash browns were cold in the middle. Scrambled eggs were not fully cooked but bacon was nice and crispy.
Worst McDonalds in the history of McDonalds. All of their employees are rude, serve cold food, and have bad attitudes.. Your better off with Taco Bell Î¾a mile away. Don't waste your time, or money.
McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.
I am only giving this location one star, because you can't give zero stars. This location can't get anything right. First, my order is wrong or incomplete 7 out of 10 times. Second, the food comes out cold or the fries will not be salted often. Third, a manager/shift supervisor was extremely rude to me simply because I went through the drive thru w/ two separate orders. Fourth, if you want ice cream it's a crap shoot. You never know if the machine will work. TERRIBLE! Worst McDonalds on the planet!!!!
I forget that I'm at McDonald's when I visit this location. It is very clean, and the food is fresh. The indoor play area is large and new. Service is good...could use a few more smiles. Sometimes I feel as if the cashier (same one each time I went) is annoyed that she actually has to work when I go up to order. But my order was always correct. I definitely recommend this location!
This place is absolutely horrible! The last 3 times I have gone there they have gotten the order wrong. This last time was the final straw. They not only got the order wrong but the food they did give us was cold! The chicken sandwich was cold and felt like cardboard! The fries were completely disgusting and soggy like they had been redropped in the fryer. The manager on duty was an absolute joke! Aubrey the manager did not offer to remake the food. I had to demand a refund from him. And then asked if it would be remade and he said, "oh you want it redone?" This is the absolute worst McDonalds and upper management should be ashamed of the level of service that is provided to their customers and the horrible quality of their food!
Why do I keep falling into this hellhole?!4 times, yes, 4, the most I chances I have given a place...either they:a) Are out of whatever you want.b) Have bad attitudes.c) Give you cold food.d) Give you melted down frozen strawberry lemonade that looks like puke, I should have taken a picture so that you would know I am not making it up.I am going to yell now, ready? STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!
McDonald's usually is good for an inexpensive, decent quick bite when you've been drinking. However, I hate clarifying 2 times that I'm ordering an unsweetened iced tea and receive a disgustingly saccharine sweet tea. I mean, this location is one that you order face-to-face through drive-thru! Î¾Here's the conversation: Î¾"I'd like an unsweetened iced tea," I pronounced. "sweetened or unsweetened?" asked the careful listener. "unsweetened," I replied. You know the rest of the story...Oh, and the southern style chicken hockey puck was both dry and burnt. This McDonald's receives 1 star because they were able to make a usual shitty dining experience even shittier.
There is one reason and one reason alone that my family comes to this McDonald's - and it's the PlayPlace. With NV's awful winter wind and scorching summers, it's a nightmare place for kids that need to run off some steam. We come here with my 5 year old sister and 8 year old brother so they can run around and to grab a drink. Usually, this location is packed with kids. This McDonald's is more expensive than other ones.
Walked into this place for the first time to get an ice cream cone while my wife shopped at nearby pet store. The older lady wearing glasses behind the counter asked me if I wanted it To-Go, "To-Go" ? it's an ice cream cone. Anyway I said To-Go, this lady then gave me the biggest Yarn as she handed me my change, then I watched her drop some kind of plastic cup on to the floor, but didn't pick it up right away. She looked like she didn't want to be there at all. i watched her prepare my ice cream cone, then she decided to pickup that cup she dropped on the floor earlier, what gets me is the way she picked it up, looked like as if she was picking up a 400 lbs weight at the gym. Then, as she was handing me my ice cream she says to me "Welcome", "Welcome" for What? Î¾I haven't said my Thank You yet !, Î¾as if she was doing me a big favor. Î¾I grewup in Japan where a customer service is probably the best in the world so maybe I'm little too critical. But I do know one thing, if this was a McDonalds in Japan, she be so Fired !
Horrible !!!! Î¾The teenagers who work here are more interested in socializing than serving customers. Î¾I have been coming to this location for over a year because it is close to my house , but must say I will drive a little further now just so my order will be correct ! Î¾I dont understand ????? Are suburb teenagers IQ's going so far down that they cant get even master a cheeseburger fries and drink order? Î¾ I get excellent correct orders at Maryland pkwy and trop location on my way to work!!!! Î¾I challenge the owner if this location to order Î¾a meal here and I would be beyond shocked if it is hot and correct! Î¾One example: i ordered a cone a diet coke and 2 coffee. Î¾They give me 2 coffee. Î¾I say " my cone?" Î¾He looks at the big bright screen with the order and Î¾says " oh ya ". Î¾Gives me my cone. Î¾ Then a few seconds pass. Î¾" my diet coke ?" Î¾Once again another long hard look at the screen followed by a puzzled look and another " uggggghh oh ya". Î¾Need I say more. Î¾Go somewhere else !!!!!
I stopped coming to this location because they NEVER give you napkins in the drive-thru..employees here are pretty grumpy.
It's a typical Mcdonald's with a play area that's great for kids to run around and burn off some energy. Î¾It hasn't been renovated like many other Mcdonalds around town but I'm sure it will be done sooner rather than later. Î¾Food was exactly what we ordered and was hot and tasty.
I usually do not care to write reviews for fast food chains, but this was the strangest experience we have had in a drive thru in a long time. Î¾When we pulled up to the first menu, we did not see a window so we glanced at the menu and pulled forward to the next menu where the intercom usually is located. Î¾We did not see one and another car was already behind us. Î¾We went around the building thinking that we missed it at the first menu only to find that located at the second menu was a big unlit sign stating that it was "personal face-to-face service" and we were to order at the window...really??? Î¾We pulled up to the first window and no one was there and neither was there a sign stating to move forward to the next window. Î¾We took the risk and pulled forward. Î¾A few seconds later a lady wearing the supervisor uniform took our order while giving another employee a hug and having a conversation with another employee. Î¾Then we saw the car behind us paying for and placing their order at the first window! Î¾Then the lady who took our order came back with our food and was trying to give us some change when she realized it belonged to the car behind us. Î¾The food was cold and old...very confusing and horrible experience at what should have been just a simple drive thru service. Î¾I am not surprised by the low ratings this location has received.
Good location, s-l-o-w service. Î¾Funny crew, on a trip through the drive thru, the cutie taking my order for a Happy Meal, asked if I would like a girl or a boy toy?, I excitedly answered "Oh!, I'll take a Boytoy!", he must of thought I was a dirty old lady, he'd be half right!
If I could give this McDonald's a negative star I would! Î¾Absolute worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Î¾They NEVER get your order right. Î¾The kids taking your order are usually texting or on their cell phones while you are trying to order. Î¾The fry containers are always half empty. Î¾They ALWAYS have a hand written sign hanging up on the drive thru that explains what they are out of. Î¾One time it was hamburger patties! Î¾We live around the corner but choose to drive an extra 5 minutes and go to any McDonald's that is not owned by the Lipscomb & Smith franchisee. Terrible....F!
This McDonalds is absolutely awful. Î¾It always seems like it is never open, its not open 24 hours like most locations, and the service is very horrible and slow. Î¾The line is always long and as said, the place is so slow. Î¾Their quality for a bacon egg and cheese biscuit is very low. Î¾The best location is Pecos and Bonanza. Î¾This one Valle Verde and Paseo Verde is the worst.
We should have read reveiws first! I'm amazed that one store in a chain can be so consistently terrible. We have now had our order screwed up three times in a row- that's three for three. We have an endlessly growing tab of free stuff from every time we have called to complain abour our order being wrong. Î¾The last time we got home with the incorrect order it was actually the store manager who completely screwed our stuff up! If you are going to bother hitting this restaurant against all recommmendation that you do not, , make SURE before you leave that the incompetent workers haven't botched your food! Î¾I GUARENTEE that they have.
The sweet tea and fries are always good but everything else on this menu at this location is meh the burgers are arguably the worst I had at any McDonald's sadly
Discusting & Dirty!!! Î¾If it weren't for my Gson I would have left. I took pictures I hope you can see what's going on here.
It's 2 for 1 review day! Î¾I can't review the Walmart without reviewing the McDonald's that resides inside. Î¾And boy is it some tantalizing stuff.I try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this McDonald's so deserves it. Î¾I hardly frequent a McDonald's at all (although this is my second McDonald's review in less than a week) but I need to let the peeps in on this one. Î¾No Yelper should go unwarned. Î¾Of course I came to McDonald's since I have those coupons for their new contraption, the McWrap. Î¾Which when I pronounce very fast and in my Scottish accent sounds much like 'McCrap'. Î¾After my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decidedly so. Î¾I need to write McDonald's execs to change the name on this thing immediately.My coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choice for FREE. Î¾I have a hard time resisting free. Î¾I'm here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!! Î¾Seriously.It was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy. Î¾I patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in McDonald's time. Î¾At least two folks left the line while I was there. Î¾I know it's not McDonald's fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs. Î¾And they were very loud. Î¾This doesn't bother me much. Î¾But...they were also very stinky. Î¾Yes, stinky. Î¾I have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in DAYS if I were to guess. Î¾To each his own, and I know it's almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN. Î¾If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back? Î¾You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y. Î¾But who am I to judge? Î¾I took a big step back and waited my turn. Î¾Free is the motivation here. Î¾I finally get up there to the McDonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy. Î¾He takes a look at it and says 'We don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it." Î¾Then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons! Î¾Mind boggling to say the least. Î¾He takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up. Î¾$2.91 later I'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.I wait. Î¾And wait. Î¾#1! Î¾#2! Î¾#3! Î¾#5! Î¾#6! Î¾#7! Î¾#8! Î¾Obviously I'm #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting. Î¾Honestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there? Î¾Mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla? Î¾Feathering a chicken? Î¾Perhaps ripening a tomato? Î¾I ask the McDonald's runner and he tells me, "We're waiting for your McWrap." Î¾Of course.At this point I'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk. Î¾Thankfully I'm only three minutes away. Î¾I really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter. Î¾Talk about disappointment! Î¾I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk. Î¾I continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald's claim to fame. Î¾Their golden fries. Î¾I bite into one, eh a bit stale. Î¾I bit into another one, eh not enough salt. Î¾I bite into yet another one, eh cold?? Î¾I look down, and whaddaya know? Î¾My damn fry is not even barely cooked! Î¾White like Olivia Wilde in the winter. Î¾I look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly! Î¾Not golden brown! Î¾Not delicious! Î¾Barely out of their frozen state, and just limp. Î¾Not acceptable! Î¾Please check my pic for proof of this travesty. Î¾McDonald's not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy. Î¾NO BUENO.After getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap. Î¾Wow, talk about lightning striking twice. Î¾This thing was lifeless! Î¾After unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off. Î¾Tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long. Î¾The chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either. Î¾After some hesitation, I took a bite. Î¾UGH I say, UGH! Î¾Freshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald's today. Î¾All cold and soggy! Î¾And upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly! Î¾Instead of having Spring Mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce! Î¾And my bacon was missing! Î¾In the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO! Î¾It was McCrap through & through. Î¾Totally upset over this one. Î¾I have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well. Î¾McDonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty. Î¾I will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure. Î¾Knowing my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap. Î¾CRAP.
This McDonald's is located at the food side entrance of the Nellis at Craig Walmart Super Center. At the time that I stopped in Walmart on the way to Utah, I ate breakfast here. This McDonald's exceeded my expectations. I expected a shoddy McDonald's in one of the Las Vegas valley' s older super centers. Instead, I was eating in a clean and surprisingly cozy McDonald's. I am under the impression that it was recently refurbished. The interior shows off McDonald's history through portraits of the first McDonald's. The booths are extraordinary comfortable for Î¾a McDonald's. Disparate from a few Las Vegas Valley Walmart McDonald's, this location offers more breakfast items. Including the egg McMuffin. Î¾On my visit, they served me the egg McMahon meal in a short period of time. The coffee was hot. And I left satisfied. Î¾Keep in mind that I ate here around 9:45 AM, before the Saturday morning rush. So, I have not seen how this McDonald's is when there is a rush of people.
I kinda wish there were negative stars. This McDonald's charged my card the wrong amount. And didn't tell me anything until I looked at my account and went back, they said my money will be returned to my account within hours. Now 3 days later my money is still not in my account. Also. I've been to other McDonald's with long drive thru lines but they are moving at an okay pace. This McDonald's drive thru lines are the slowest I've been in.
No, just no. I understand that the food I order will never ever come out like it looks in the picture, but gadaam, don't mean you gotta give me burnt buns on both my mcdoubles. Women, I told you no pickles.. and what did I get?? Probably the largest slices in the bunch. Now I get it's Î¾morning... your tired.. well I'm tired too! When I say good morning at the window I expect some kinda of acknowledgement.
Kids playplace smells awful and there is food everywhere. Î¾Will never go there except the drive thru. Î¾Drive thru staff is very pleasant and polite, but it doesn't make up for the messy playplace.
