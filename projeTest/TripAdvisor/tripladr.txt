Went here to grab a breakfast with wife and daughter as we are on holiday!. Place looks extremely clean, new style order points which in my opinion take to long to navigate around however there was a staff member there to assist!.

One thing I like about McDonald's is that you can visit one almost anywhere and know what type of food and service you'll get. I ate twice at this one whenI needed a decent meal quickly.

They claim to be the world's largest McDonalds, and the building looks like a super-duper super-sized order of fries to prove it. Seems like just a lot of marketing hype, but whether true or not, this is certainly NOT you usual McDonalds.

This McDonald's was super clean and overstaffed. I learned that there was a mcdonalds convention going on so they had lots of managers working. My tray was picked up by a fellow in a suit.

Claims to be the biggest in the world, but this doesn't mean the best. The place is so run down and tacky. The upstairs with the arcades looks like something from the 70s/80's.

I though it very odd that the restaurant didn't have any business, but one family when we went in. No one was going through the drive thru. Then we ordered double cheese and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were not warm enough to pull. The double cheese pitiful.

This is one of the reasons I don't do alot of mcdonalds they can't get it right and the tea really taste nasty I do drink the sweet tea and it was old and tasted like there was no sugar in it at all

A must with kids when you struggle to get same food as back home as any mac's good fast food go for it.

There can never be a dull day when you have a Mcdonalds around. Excellent service and we tried the new buttermilk crisp chicken burger. Back in South Africa we are not offered refillable drinks and free dips so it was most welcomed here

Everyone in our party loved it here, the only down side is the people that crowd around you asking you to buy time shares its annoying!

This is such a nice McDonald, I was pleasantly surprised. I had stop going to the chain because I felt that most were nasty and unhealthy.. This one in particular had a nice ambience.. I almost felt like I was somewhere else.. They list the calorie count and that egg white breakfast sandwich could rival Panera Bread.

It is open 24 Hrs. and has a huge selection. Not the usual McDonalds. Desserts are wonderful!!! Very large inside. Quick service and my wrap was huge!!!! Our food was fresh and delicious! Very busy place. Don't go thru drive thru, go inside and check it out. A little hard to get in and out/busy intersection.

This 24-hour McDonald's seem to be improved since my last visit a couple years ago, but I'm surprised that management can't train their employees better. But, Believe It or Not, even with uninspired, untrained, and clueless counter help, the service is relatively fast and the food is surprisingly good. This is a busy place.

We are not typically McDonald's fans - but who can't resist an egg mcmuffin? Plus they had a 2 for 1 on their egg mcmuffins, when we were there. So you can really get a bang for your buck. You typically have to ask for more napkins because they usually give you just 1.

I made the mistake of driving off in this drive- thru without checking my bag to ensure that my order was correct. When I noticed that two of the sandwiches were missing the eggs, I turned back around and the manager didn't apologize and gave me the bag back with my new sandwiches. I just knew they were correct because...

Decent food, clean place, not a great deal to say. However the woman taking the order perhaps couldn't understand our British accents (and we don't have any regional twang whatsoever - think Cat Deeley or Pierce Morgan). Anyhow, we can forgive her as the food was lovely and McDonalds in America is so much better quality, far better presented and...

It was close to clarion and was only a couple of minutes away. Food was good just like at home and was open 24 hours for a late night snack if you wanted.

We were on holiday with our Daughter and Grandkids. We have been to Florida and to Walt Disney’s Theme Parks on previous occasions and had been impressed with this Disney World, two of our Grandkids one who is now 13 years old and one who is now 19 years old have visited here only once previously. But for our 7...

Even though you are used to McDonald's from where you are from this one makes it a bit different for you, loved the way it was ran, has arcades and stuff inside. This McDonald's has a pizza and pasta bar inside also. The portions are reasonable, chips are huge and so are the drink but burgers are just standard.

Busy place at the Orland airport. We had time to grab a dinner type meal before boarding the airplane. Happy meal for Granddaughter, cheeseburger for niece and me. Fries are the best when hot. Shakes are the best all around for me! Good service.

I usually don't go to Mickey D's, but everything else near was so expensive . The place was clean, & well staffed.

Great parking, great a/c. Chaotic ordering with screen and then having to queue with people who were ordering direct - why have the same queue? Get your own drinks rather than being served. Food was average, fries were appalling. Had better in the UK every time, I was looking for the authentic US experience but no way was I getting...

Have had a couple of quick
Snack breaks here during our holiday.
It has a huge play area within the restaurant - this is free & our 8 year old loved it. There is also a 'man' playing a piano in the upstairs section - entertaining !
However apart from
One young lad all the other staff we encountered were...

Expensive compared to uk, for 4 big Mac meals and 4milk shakes medium came to over 34 dollars, the milkshakes were more chocolatey and had whipped cream on top.

As a frequent traveler I have always been able to reply on McDonalds to have good tea. However, this particular McDonalds was a massive disappointment. I think it had an automatic lemon flavor, but I can't be sure that was it. All I know for certain is that it was not the standard tea McDonalds usually serves. I couldn't even...
