Didn't feel too safe in this macdonalds.
There were signs up telling you how long you could stay there and how long you had to wait before you could come back, not very welcoming
The staff were polite and did their jobs well

Very Busy, Courteous staff. Food was good. Helped with any directions needed to find a location in Time's Square.

we ate here for breakfast the food was really nice and food was pipping hot,the coffee was just right too

Went for quick bit to eat. Service was super quick and staff were polite and helpful. Loads and loads of seating so a great place to recharge. Recommend

I was with my wife at Times Square at lunch time. Due to the fact that it was cold and raining and my wife likes the Big Mac; the McDonalds at 42nd.St. was the perfect choice for both of us. The outside of the restaurant looks like the entrance of a Broadway Theater, and the building inside is impressively massive...

This McDonalds was not the best nor the worst we've ever been to. The food was average, the staff was unfriendly an the restaurant was a mess. Perhaps they need t hire more staff. But if you just want something on the fly, it's okay.
"

Actually, if you want some good McDonald's, this is the place. Menu selections are pretty standard & understandably, the food is mostly heavy & not the healthiest. Once in a while it's okay to splurge & after taking in a movie on the block, the food is familiar & comforting. Ordering lines move quickly & there's usually plenty of seating...

Consistent McDonald's but large enough for seating very large crowds. Clean, well tended restrooms. Fantastic location if you want to wait inside for your show to start and grab a cheap snack.

Our first meal of our trip was at this McD's,-new to town, no idea where to eat-go with what you know lol. It is right on the strip, has a walk up window, open doors, and two floors of seating. Service was quick & food was great. A Mcdonalds sign with flashing lights flashed above the restaurant-neat to see. Quite...

The food is standard McDonalds...but if they have the upstairs closed off...at breakfast time?? you will be hard pressed to find a place to sit downstairs in the extremely limited seating.

I only remember this McDonald as it looked like set plan for a music video.It has big plasma TV`s playing music videos.You can sit on ground floor or on the entresol (kind of balcony ) and you can see people on the lower floor.
"

Busy as in the heart of theatre land and just off Broadway. located between one of the theatres and Madame Tussauds. Service at the counter was slow - seating upstairs
"

Good place to dine all items,especially chicken for asians-Indians.
Central location and no need think to enter here.
Mouth watering taste,even when you cross this location

I don't like fast food, but brakfast at McDonalds is different. We had breakfast at his branch more than once, and the sitting area is great.
"

Like all the rest, this McDonald's was Average. They had a really cool walk up window right off the street so you didn't have to go inside, however, the workers are very sloooow! We usually just stopped for a iced tea, soda, and it took them forever!
"
"
A handy spot for a quick bite. Clean and tidy - and on 42nd. Near our hotel too. Good variety of food.
"
"
it was great Mcdonalds moment well located and quite good maintained despite of the facts thousands of people are going there to eat... the toilets and table were regularly cleaned and it was quite pleasant experience.

The place is clean and a great location to meet your group. There's plenty of seating on the second floor that you won't feel crowded in.

Food was just like any but service is poor. My entire order was wrong plus I didn't even get what I wanted. The guy at the cashier waved me off and completely ignored me. We ate someone else's meal. Pretty sad to see. The whole serving process was not controlled. They took your money and they moved you on.
Never...

With Mickey D's nearby, you'll never go hungry. You get exactly what you expect. That's the genius of McDonald's. Enjoy!

It's MC Donalds. Nice to know exactly what your getting and save a bunch of money in NYC. Only went in for one breakfast , we were in a hurry the last day to catch the ferry. No complaints.

We went to both McDonalds in Time Square and this restaurant has normal prices. Sweet Teas are like a $1.30. Frape' is still around $3.xx. They have awesome seating on the 2nd floor; They also have clean restrooms. We found it a GREAT FEAT to find a restaurant that also had a bathroom in New York period- so keep that...

No one reads reviews of McDonald's before you visit but if you do - please consider going elsewhere. It really is that bad. Little space to order when you arrive plus 1000's of people hurling through the doors at every moment leads to a chaotic experience.

There has to be a reason. Seating is neat, four levels. Some homeless, but they have have a homeless cop. Food was McDonalds-ish with efficiency for the shear volume of people. Cheap eats on Times Square.

I can't believe I am saying it, but I did not enjoy eating here. I am a big fan of McDonalds, I always eat at McDonalds because it cheap, fast and tasty. My first meal in New York was here, that's how big a fan I am of McDonalds. I was disappointed, I got a Big Mac Meal with a...

This place is organized to take orders like a state D.M.V. there is no order, no lines, no reason. The signage is for people 12 feet or tall. If you are choking good luck with someone trying to read the chocking instruction sheet that is posted 10 feet from the floor.

After visiting Macdonald's all over the world (including Moscow, El Cairo and the excellent Macdonald's in Tanger, Morocco) we can proclaim this 220 West 42St. the worst of all Macdonald's restaurants on Earth.
Awful and terrible service from an Afro-American girl, almost insulting.
Fries were colder than cold.

Located close to the Time Square on the 42nd street this ia a huge
McDonalds which remains all time crowded with people. The front
entrace resembles more like a 70s-80s theater hall and the inside is a
bit retro styled. Nothing special otherwise as the McDonalds menu is
same across locations. This one needed special mention because of its
location...

This McDonald's is in an old theater on 42nd street near Times Square. The food is usual fare but the outside theatre marquee is marvelous. And the second floor of the McDonald's uses the old theatre theme to make a really cool atmosphere. Even if you only want a drink, do yourself a favor and check out the upstairs of...

food was good, service was fine. After all, thats what we look for in a quick eat restaurant!
I liked the coffee and food served, and will definitely recommend to others

For a fast food place the service was very slow and food was macDonalds normal standard previously in USA meat appeared to be of higher standard

For a quick lunch near Time Squares, that is a good spot. There is 2 floors for sitting and also a walk window serving. It is clean. The design of the place is nice and they project music video on the walls.

This was the largest McDonald's in the world, or least that is what we were told. There are so many cashiers that the wait time is very low. This is definitely what you will call Fast Food. However I did not like the decor since it was dim and poorly lit. It creates a feeling like you are out in...

We went to this McDonald's location after seeing the Newsies musical. We opened the back door and walked into a very dark, seedy seating area unlike any other McDonald's location you've ever been to!! This location was like a giant warehouse and was very busy. Service was fast and everything was o.k., however, on the door their rating was \"Grade...

If you are ready to wait in long line up and longing for reasonable fast food - YES to this place. Line ups move fast however the place has too many people in and out. Location is great right at Times Square,

very fast service,if you have little time or want to take the kids is the right place.service and quality according to standard mac donalds.

Usually i believe Mcdonalds holds approx. the same overall quality from place to place, but the big mac i bought here tasted terrible. Same goes for the mc nuggets, dry and nasty. I got the sense that they had been stoored a while even though there were alot of customers at the time.

Okay, don't like to go their on a trip, but ended up at the one in Times Square 2x before Aladdin and Newsies! Great family deal for $19.99, and New York style exterior and interior, with clean bathrooms.

I went to the McD on the Broadway just because the place looked like a theatre. they also have a cute theatre counter where you can pick up food. It was a cool place to hang out.

The largest McDonalds in the world is been a kind of delusion. The menu was aligned at the european counterparts. I chose a BigMac and my wife a simple hamburger. The meat was not so tasty while the BigMac had nothing close the Big.
The crew is not been so useful about my wife's intolerance at lactose. The waitress did...

Good for quick meal at reasonable prices and available bathrooms & free internet. But depends on the time of the day, since it's at Time Square it can get really busy with long line for food & bathroom. I was lucky and didn't have to deal with either.

I was shocked to eat at McDonald's time square. We waited in the queue for over 50 minutes to be served. The place was dirty. The food was terrible The fries were so hard, it was like eating sticks.

Although there is a bit of a wait in this very busy restaurant, it was easy to find a spot upstairs. We love their fresh and tasty salads, and just walked in for a quick bite while walking around New York City.

Well ... it's a McDonalds! Not a whole lot more to say about the food.
Surprisingly, though, the store is very clean, service is reasonably quick and courteous, and the familiar fare is everything you expect.
Not to mention, from the outside, this McDonald's looks like a block-buster movie! Very cool, and totally in the Times Square spirit!
"

Are you looking for a photo of Elmo with your kids?. Then this is the best place to go. I once walked past here and there were five of them. Getting food here is another story, as it is crazy busy and even just getting something simple be prepared for a long wait and a short tempered service.

Busiest place in Times Square. No moving space no matter what time of day it is. Kudos to the staff for dealing with the large amounts of people as effectively as they could.

My family and I eat at the McDonalds located at 151 West 34th Street in New York City. It was very crowded and busy. However, we we got our order very quickly and found a suitable place to eat. The food was typical McDonald fare. The meal was hot and the kids enjoyed it.
"

For lack of food choices in this outlet, I went and ordered their mushroom angus beef burger! So so lousy, big regret! Even the fires are soggy. Maybe because there are not much people, their burgers are old stock, frozen and thawed! Yucks! Super yuck!

I never get sick from McDonald's! I'm not sure if the meat, and chemicals that they put into their food is always good for you...but I can never resist a good McChicken sandwich! Try it with ranch dressing....it's great! I love their sweet tea, chicken nuggets, hamburgers, and salty fries too! I especially love their hot fudge and strawberry sundaes!...
