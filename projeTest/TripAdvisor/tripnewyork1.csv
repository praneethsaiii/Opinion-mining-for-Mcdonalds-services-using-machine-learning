We had a quick snack and got good McDonalds food for a reasonable price and with not too much wait, considering the crowds of people everywhere.

McDonalds is what it is. Fast food cheap. Service was fast. Asked to buy a glass of water and was told I had to buy a dasani. Hubby does not like dasani. Asked again and offered to buy a glass of water and was ignored. The iced tea was good as always and the smoothies were cold.

Our hotel was in Times Square so this was an easy walk. After paying a small fortune in other restaurants that had no seating, we started coming here.

Mcdonalds on Broadway is a standard chain restaurant near Times Square. It is almost always busy. Food is as expected. The price is right BUT service is slow and it is hard to keep the premises clean. This is a reasoned choice for a quick, cheap bite but don't expect anything special.

It's understandable that it's hard for such a restaurant to remain clean, tidy and ordered at this location. But the speed they dealt with our order is a bit more slower, as I felt. Anyway, like the decoration style on its second floor, as well as the view over the square!

We were in a bit of a hurry, just like most everybody in NYC, and needed a breakfast that was budget-lite...MacD's was ready for us, and right next to our hotel. Breakfast was served promptly, and there was ample seating upstairs. Recommended.

The only reason I came here was because my 17 year old son wanted a burger. I do not eat anything on the menu because of the fat content.

Ordering food was intense with the lines, but good food. and they didn't seem to find special orders, just takes a few minutes. Order more than one soda to go! They'll put them in a bag for you! There is a lot of seating upstairs, and the bathrooms were clean, down this big open hallway.

You would think the prices on time square would be doubled, but the food prices in the McDonald's is the same as the one's near my home in DC. They are fast and easy when you are in a rush with family and don't want to spend your whole budget on overpriced New York City food.

For a Canadian family, any of the NYC McDonald's restaurants offer a unique perspective on their creative use of real estate. A Big Mac is a Big Mac but to sit in one of these busy hubs shows you how fast a place this really is. Very neat to see a McD's that is 2-storeys.

Mcdonalds on Broadway is a standard chain restaurant near Times Square. It is almost always busy. Food is as expected. The price is right BUT service is slow and it is hard to keep the premises clean. This is a reasoned choice for a quick, cheap bite but don't expect anything special.

Ordering food was intense with the lines, but good food. and they didn't seem to find special orders, just takes a few minutes. Order more than one soda to go! They'll put them in a bag for you! There is a lot of seating upstairs, and the bathrooms were clean, down this big open hallway.

For a Canadian family, any of the NYC McDonald's restaurants offer a unique perspective on their creative use of real estate. A Big Mac is a Big Mac but to sit in one of these busy hubs shows you how fast a place this really is. Very neat to see a McD's that is 2-storeys.

When we went to Times Square, the kids got hungry and so were the adults and the fast food place we saw was, McDonald's restaurant. This is like no McDonald's you've ever been too. There were around 10 cashiers taking orders, but, they were a bit slow or overloaded with customers. The people working the register were confused and the...

It's understandable that it's hard for such a restaurant to remain clean, tidy and ordered at this location. But the speed they dealt with our order is a bit more slower, as I felt. Anyway, like the decoration style on its second floor, as well as the view over the square!

We were in a bit of a hurry, just like most everybody in NYC, and needed a breakfast that was budget-lite...MacD's was ready for us, and right next to our hotel. Breakfast was served promptly, and there was ample seating upstairs. Recommended.

The only reason I came here was because my 17 year old son wanted a burger. I do not eat anything on the menu because of the fat content.

Ordering food was intense with the lines, but good food. and they didn't seem to find special orders, just takes a few minutes. Order more than one soda to go! They'll put them in a bag for you! There is a lot of seating upstairs, and the bathrooms were clean, down this big open hallway.

Remove yourself from the crush of Times Square by dropping into here. Always a lot of people and a line, but you can get into the bathroom. Probably the cheapest cup of coffee in Times Square.

You would think the prices on time square would be doubled, but the food prices in the McDonald's is the same as the one's near my home in DC. They are fast and easy when you are in a rush with family and don't want to spend your whole budget on overpriced New York City food.

Nothing to complain about quality of food. It's Mickey Dees.
What I did want to say, was this little Hispanic manager, female, assisting the cashiers with food orders was a complete BEOTCH. I ordered a 2 cheese burger meal, standard. I didn't care it was expensive for MDees.
The fries were only half full. This beotch gave me this dirty...

Our New York City hotel offered a breakfast buffet for $33 per person. We chose to spend our money on other attractions, so we ate at this McDonalds restaurant each morning during our stay. They provided great service and affordable, delicious food. Three of us ate for less than the price of one at the hotel buffet.

Staying locally so used this McD for a meal. Servers had no personality, refused to smile and it was almost as if the wholw thing was a serving machine. I watched our server carry a bag to the serving shelf and back about 7 times waiting for a \"f of f\" to be prepared - everything else was sitting waiting....

For a Canadian family, any of the NYC McDonald's restaurants offer a unique perspective on their creative use of real estate. A Big Mac is a Big Mac but to sit in one of these busy hubs shows you how fast a place this really is. Very neat to see a McD's that is 2-storeys.

Very friendly staff and extensive menu - much better than the UK version we are used to. Much better value too. The restaurant itself was so much cleaner than the UK versions and a more 'adult' setting than the UK 'cartoon' restaurants. I now understand why Americans love it so much!!

The only reason I came here was because my 17 year old son wanted a burger. I do not eat anything on the menu because of the fat content.

Ordering food was intense with the lines, but good food. and they didn't seem to find special orders, just takes a few minutes. Order more than one soda to go! They'll put them in a bag for you! There is a lot of seating upstairs, and the bathrooms were clean, down this big open hallway.

You would think the prices on time square would be doubled, but the food prices in the McDonald's is the same as the one's near my home in DC. They are fast and easy when you are in a rush with family and don't want to spend your whole budget on overpriced New York City food.

This McDonalds is a good breakfast stop. Cheap prices, good meals and fast service. I thought the tator tots here were really good and also enjoyed the breakfast burritos.

Ok keep in mind we're talking about a fast food chain here, that said I went there to try some american fast food in america.
The staff was not attentive, they seemed like they didn't care about the customer or about what they were doing.
The did not pay attention to the order so things were missing after they said...

The McDonalds in Times Square was adequate, but service very slow. We hit it of a morning, because it was close, was not definitely our first choice, but some times convenience wins out.

Okay, you know what you are getting. But what a deal - $20 for a family of four. Clean restrooms. Sandwiched next to Aladdin and behind Newsies! With a marquee out front!

Usual McDonald's quality, great panorama, beautiful forniture and there are a lot of seats always suitable at any hour, it's just few step from the pumping heart of new York.. Definitively I strongly suggest this place

We went to McDonalds on Time Square once for lunch and once for breakfast. On both occasions the food was good and very tasty. The staff were pleasant and efficient and the restaurant was very clean. We would recommend it.

For a Canadian family, any of the NYC McDonald's restaurants offer a unique perspective on their creative use of real estate. A Big Mac is a Big Mac but to sit in one of these busy hubs shows you how fast a place this really is. Very neat to see a McD's that is 2-storeys.

Very friendly staff and extensive menu - much better than the UK version we are used to. Much better value too. The restaurant itself was so much cleaner than the UK versions and a more 'adult' setting than the UK 'cartoon' restaurants. I now understand why Americans love it so much!!

You can order new different food. Was open late. Lots of police using this, so felt safe.

McConald's on 42St is a whirlwind. Two stories and fell of people at all hours. It takes a little while to get your order, but you get fresh fries with that. Typical food, and value, but for lunch on the run, just fine. It's also really well located next to Madame Tussauds.

If you own this store you can't go wrong. With something happening 24 hours a day there is always going to be customers going through the door.

Normally, I really don't like McDonald's but this place was cool. The first floor was crowded sometimes but the second and third was not really a lot. They were playing music videos and it was cool. I liked using the free WiFi because my hotel (Hilton Times Square) only hade free wifi in the lobby.

I am not a fan of McDonald's food but will get an oreo blizzard when the ice cream crave hits and nothing else is open.
