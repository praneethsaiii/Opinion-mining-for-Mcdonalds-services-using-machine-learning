Welcome to the new generation McDonald's. McDonald's like this existed so far in Europe only. It's nice it's clean there are plenty of people and the service is good. The food itself is about the same, but you have additional choices like pastas and pizzas or burgers to your own liking. So overall the nicest McDonald's experience for me so...

Have previously been to the older version before the make over. All very posh and stylish inside. Fast and friendly service, at a reasonable price. Worth checking out. Massive kids play area on the first floor. Ride range of food, such as pizza.

This place has been totally rebuilt, nice and fresh looking, they have order points to keep queuing to a minimum, they have gourmet selection and other additions definitely worth a visit

Nothing great. Poor service on counter by another stereotypical server on the counter. Flung herself on the counter when I pointed out 2 big errors on my bill. Exchanged words with one another then left after my meal. Never again.

Their milkshakes are 100% better than uk, but all in all its McDonald's. There is however a large kids play area so the little ones can burn a bit off the edges

This McDonald's is EPIC! They have chefs cooking fresh pasta and pizza made to order. You can order your food at a kiosk and have someone bring your food to the table. I ordered chicken pasta alfredo with mushrooms and broccoli served in a real glass bowl and a real fork. It was served with garlic bread and was delicious!...

I may not be typical - but I hated this place. Starting with the self-service menu screens - you touch what you want.

This McDonalds is the largest location but it was a bit odd and outdated. There is a new one being built next door which I believe is still going to be a huge one. Great arcade upstairs. Lots of foods that you don't expect to see at McDonalds. Pastas, pizza, sandwiches, waffles.

Largest McD's perhaps; oddest certainly. Feels like it's in a timewarp. They do 'other' food here. On actual plates. You can see it unappetising displayed in perspex cases - pizza, Mexican dishes... Be warned, the 'gourmet' stuff may arrive 15 mins after your fries. Philly Cheese Steak is actually a cheesy mince sandwich.
Oh, and Thursday night is karaoke night.

Obviously, the owners were trying very hard to create something special, but what resulted was pretty confusing. While you order in one place, and pay in another, where you pick up your order depends on what you ordered. I had standard McFare and got my order where I paid, but my wife ordered a specialty salad and it was only...

For the World's Biggest McDonalds, they certainly aren't the best. The restaurant itself has a terrible ordering system where you order your food at the till before reaching the counter.

Not much to say regarding McDonalds really. Larger selection of food than most regular McDonalds and a larger building with alot of arcade games etc. inside. Open 24hr. Excellent Milkshakes!! Same poor standard of customer service as any UK restaurant. Take your order and money as quickly as possible and ship you towards the food collection counter, stand waiting for...

Now, I'm not one for a play on words... ah, who am I kiddin? Im lovin it.
Firstly, it's 24 hour 7 days a week and has free wifi.
The restaurant purports to be the largest in the world, however this is not true - read the statement carefully and it actually says its the largest McDonalds with a games...

This McDonalds used to be the largest in the World until the Olympics in London.I am not very keen on these type of restaurants but did get a cheeseburger and milk shake there,it is always extremely busy,the staff try to keep up with the amount of customers but inevitably there is a shortage of one thing or another!Kids love it!

Gourmet food and automatic toilet seat covers! I was in awe! I couldn't believe I was at McDonald's!

Good consistent food which is quite reasonable especially if you get a voucher from the many complimentary booklets.
However,milkshakes are very sweet which I found almost undrinkable ( same in BK though too )!

This one on international drive was crazy! They have regular mcdonalds menu but also have pizza, subs, Alfredo, fettuccini , all kinds of menu items, packed inside, loud busy, busy, place. Looks quiet outside. Prices are much higher than most other McDonald's I have seen in other places. But they do have the McDonald's food so if our looking a...

Took at bit of getting used to the serving system and not exactly sure it was fast food as the various stages for ordering seemed to take much longer ! However staff generally very friendly choice was excellent as was coffee and couldn't believe the taco salad , parfait and oatmeal options all excellent.

Now I realise it's McDonald's but this particular branch is so suped up with everything that could make you mad - tables & chairs too close together, too many children (sorry) and arcade machines constantly making noises.
Of course, I still visited for my hit of chocolate sundaes!

This Micky Ds is not the usual and almost a resort unto itself. If you are in the area for a few days, know doubt your hectic schedule will mean you stop there. It is classic Orlando.
"

Could walk to it from our hotel and they gave AAA discounts, just ask at the register! Fun activities for the kids and they offer more than just the basic McDonald's food..

The sign says \"Prepare to be dazzled\". OK, I was, open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, wow. Hot food and ice cream, too.
On the inside this place was huge.

We just got back home from a recent vacation to Orlando - Feb.4th-14th. When we walked into the McDonalds on Sand Lake Road - we were disturbed a bit because all of the employees were acting like they were having some sort of party - everyone was dancing around, talking & laughing - not paying attention to any of the...

I appreciated the free WIFI, as it was time for lunch and a \"rest\"
fairly clean for a McDonald's......

Thought it would be a large play place and it was but the rest of it was pay to play video games and it was not like a quarter. The sales people hitting you at the door was a big turn off. They don't even have a value menu.

This 2-story McDonalds is really unique. Located at 6875 Sand Lake Rd., Orlando, FL this McDonalds has it all -- an expanded bistro gourmet menu like waffles, panini sandwiches, custom breakfasts (besides the standard menu) and video games arcade area. Open 24 hours. I like the free wi fi and electric outlets.

nice place compared to other mcdonalds but expensive compared to UK, twice the price of ours, play area for kids and extra menu, pizza and seafood
"

Stopped to get some reasonable priced ice cream. It's really expensive most places but here its same as all Mcdonalds, so it's cheap as you can get anywhere.

Been to Orlando two years on the trot and last year (2015), it was o'k with fast food and a McDonalds as you expect, with a 24 hour right on your doorstep.
This year, saw a major transformation which has brought it into the 21st Century with self-ordering units and a great place to eat, so much improved on last...

30 minutes later we get our order flat cold and half missing. It happens, they're bust and I wasn't annoyed... that is until the staff made me feel criminal for requesting the order correcticting and threw the food at me!! Still half missing they asked why I was still there... in the end I was so mad I left without...

Where do I start with this review? This has got to be the worst McDs I've been too. It is supposed to be the worlds largest McDs. It is big but it just can't cope. The new self service ordering via the giant iPad type devices was a disaster. Despite following all of the instructions you still need to go...

The size of this McDonald's was what drew us in. The boys quickly were hypnotized by the ginormous presence of the Golden Arches so we did a quick u-turn and pulled in. As all the other reviews point out, it is BUSY in here. Super busy.
Lines move quick though and food options are a bit more robust as you...

It is been a while since the last time we were here but the renovation was really great. The place looks very good and the food is a chapter apart. My kids had the normal McDonald's food and they said that was good but I had a chicken Alfredo that was delicious. I could never imagine having anything like that...
