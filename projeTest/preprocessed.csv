"7.content","I'm not crazi about this McDonald's. Î¾This is primarili becaus they are so slow. Î¾Mi gosh what exact is the hold up? Î¾It FAST food people. Î¾Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. Î¾I now know that he is tri to get as mani hour as possibl becaus he need money BAD. Î¾Spread the word. Î¾Anyway, this locat is on a littl access road Î¾and you have to go back the way you came becaus there is no exit from it at the other end. Î¾It would have help if there was one. Î¾So, in the end I think I'll avoid this locat and find another. Î¾This should be easi as there is no shortag of Mickey D in this piece."

"9.content","Never been upset about ani fast food drive thru servic till I came to this McDonalds.Aft a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonald for a quick bite to eat befor our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of car wait to order. We were guess there must be a lot demand for McDonald at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minut for our turn to order. We order the special they were have at that time (20 pcs chicken nugget for $5) and ask for a cup of water becaus we didn't want to drink ani soda at that late hour. They take our order but tell us they don't serv cup of water there. So we are a littl annoy but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receiv our order. However, we wait for almost anoth 10 min to final pay at the first window - then anoth 5 more min to final receiv our food. By far the worst McDonald in the world. Unfriend and slow."

Usualli you wouldn't find me actual insid a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stack stone, lot of larg window and a flat screen TV usual on HLN.

I work late night and when I do get off work if there noth readi in the hous I will stop and my onli option is McDonald or Checkers. Needless to say this is noth short of ""ghetto"". I could hear the employe in the background laugh and play over the intercom as I'm order the food. After I ordered, she didn't even bother to tell me my total or go over my order with me. Î¾When I made it to the window she was have a convers with her co worker despit me have my hand out the window to give her the money. When I drove up to the second window....someon had been smoke a cigarett and threw it right outsid the drive-through window. Now I don't know if it was mayb a previous custom or and employe but nobodi was in front of me when I pull up but hard to say. I could hear the music they were play over my radio in the car and to top it off. Somebodi was call anoth chick a ""B*tch"" and just be loud. I mean hey, didn't expect noth spectacular but if these are the peopl that make my Big Mac, I'll pass. The day shift is the complet opposit so don't be discourag too much by this. My food tast McDonald worthi but they need to chang up that sceneri a bit."

The first is it conveni location. The second: my food is alway hot and prepar correctly. Despit the ridicul slow line, I've never receiv cold fri or a wrong order.

And for you peopl who chose to live in ""hidden cove"" next to, and east of, McDonalds... you have no luck in be abl to pull out easily.

Î¾That the onli logic explan becaus everi worker here has transform into McDumbasses!I want to remind you that this is Summerlin, so that mean that everyon run stop signs, no one yield for pedestrians, Î¾and everyon argu over the stupidest most insignific things.

About 2 minut later I begin hear a ton of static and then this bizarr sound guy start talk in this strang tone. He sound like a drunk Orson Wells. When I pull up to the first window to pay, the window slowli slid open to reveal the face of a morbid look kid with gigant dilat eye and one of those horror movi smiles.

They'r alway out of something, there never a cashier in the first drive- through window (where your suppos to pay) so peopl sit in their car and wait for a cashier to magic appear to take their money..not happening!

Whi do I keep go back?Hav noth to do with Mcdonald food in general and more to do with the abil of this specif locat to produc it with out kill anybody. I have been go to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I use to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretti much everyth I use (gas station, costco, movi theater, market, etc). It is the onli conveni location, and for a while Mcdonald was the onli place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excus for repeat tortur myself with this horribl place! Service: I use to be a manag with anoth fast food chain. I know what servic SHOULD be. I also know what it usual is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridicul slow service, and inabl to get a singl order right is realli a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talk 15 minut is averag drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasion be complic (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they mess up an order for 4 larg drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet ice tea (all with extra ice). We receiv a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet ice tea. 2 drink had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few piec float around. We have never receiv a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad exampl and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrect made: Someth a littl differ then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrect or dangerously. Some of the exampl of this includ pie that expir an hour befor I receiv them, an egg that was complet raw in the middle, and tonight love mess up. Tonight I order the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. Accord to the websit this should includ 2 full slice of swiss chees and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relat old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patti they should have used. I have call the number on the receipt multipl time that take me to the district office. They consist send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorri they are and suggest I tri one of their other locations, as this is the onli one they receiv complaint from. From what I was told they are revamp this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seem to have been unvamp and go down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vow this will be my last visit, but then find myself sit in the drive thru line yet again wonder if I will ever receiv my food. I high do not recommend this location.

Î¾And boy is it some tantal stuff.I tri not to give too mani 1-star review but this McDonald so deserv it. Î¾I hard frequent a McDonald at all (although this is my second McDonald review in less than a week) but I need to let the peep in on this one. Î¾No Yelper should go unwarned. Î¾Of cours I came to McDonald sinc I have those coupon for their new contraption, the McWrap. Î¾Which when I pronounc veri fast and in my Scottish accent sound much like McCrap'. Î¾After my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decid so. Î¾I need to write McDonald exec to chang the name on this thing immediately.Mi coupon for the day was buy a medium fri and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choic for FREE. Î¾I have a hard time resist free. Î¾I'm here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!! Î¾Seriously.It was the tail end of lunchtim so the line was still a bit busy. Î¾I patient wait for almost 10 minutes...which is like forev in McDonald time. Î¾At least two folk left the line while I was there. Î¾I know it not McDonald fault, but the coupl in front of me took up major of the line space becaus they were in motor wheelchairs. Î¾And they were veri loud. Î¾This doesn't bother me much. Î¾But...they were also veri stinky. Î¾Yes, stinky. Î¾I have no problem with stinki in most case (I occasion help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't wash in DAYS if I were to guess. Î¾To each his own, and I know it almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN. Î¾If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back? Î¾You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y. Î¾But who am I to judge? Î¾I took a big step back and wait my turn. Î¾Free is the motiv here. Î¾I final get up there to the McDonald cashier and present my coupon to the guy. Î¾He take a look at it and say We don't usual take the promo coupon at this locat but we'll let you use it."" Î¾Then he proceed to put the coupon onto a stack of...mor coupons! Î¾Mind boggl to say the least. Î¾He take my order of a medium fri and medium drink, ask me what type of McWrap I want (Grill Chicken & Bacon) and ring me up. Î¾$2.91 later I'm given my receipt and ask to wait for my number to be called.I wait. Î¾And wait. Î¾#1! Î¾#2! Î¾#3! Î¾#5! Î¾#6! Î¾#7! Î¾#8! Î¾Obviousli I'm #4 and 10 minut later I am still waiting. Î¾Honestly, what the Hell are you guy do back there? Î¾Mix the masa for my fresh press tortilla? Î¾Feather a chicken? Î¾Perhap ripen a tomato? Î¾I ask the McDonald runner and he tell me, ""We'r wait for your McWrap."" Î¾Of course.At this point I'm almost run late to be back at work, so the minut I get my order I bolt back to the offic and have lunch at my desk. Î¾Thank I'm onli three minut away. Î¾I really, realli should have just gone to the vend machin or eaten my stash of Rees chocol peanut butter egg from last Easter. Î¾Talk about disappointment! Î¾I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fri on my desk. Î¾I continu work while munch away on what is suppos to be McDonald claim to fame. Î¾Their golden fries. Î¾I bite into one, eh a bit stale. Î¾I bit into anoth one, eh not enough salt. Î¾I bite into yet anoth one, eh cold?? Î¾I look down, and whaddaya know? Î¾Mi damn fri is not even bare cooked! Î¾White like Olivia Wild in the winter. Î¾I look through the entir box and find at least half a dozen fri not cook properly! Î¾Not golden brown! Î¾Not delicious! Î¾Bare out of their frozen state, and just limp. Î¾Not acceptable! Î¾Pleas check my pic for proof of this travesty. Î¾McDonald not do their fri right is like IKEA not serv their Swedish Meatbal with gravy. Î¾NO BUENO.After get over this somewhat I final hit my stride to go on to my Grill Chicken & Bacon McWrap. Î¾Wow, talk about lightn strike twice. Î¾This thing was lifeless! Î¾After unwrap this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell someth was off. Î¾Tortilla was alreadi show sign of be soggi way too long. Î¾The chicken peek out of the top was not look tip top shape either. Î¾After some hesitation, I took a bite. Î¾UGH I say, UGH! Î¾Fresh was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald today. Î¾All cold and soggy! Î¾And upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly! Î¾Instead of have Spring Mix like it suppos to, there was plain old shred iceberg lettuce! Î¾And my bacon was missing! Î¾In the word of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO! Î¾It was McCrap through & through. Î¾Total upset over this one. Î¾I have pictur proof of this travesti of gourmet eat as well. Î¾McDonald you have piss off the wrong fatty. Î¾I will definit be call your hotlin to complain about this one for sure. Î¾Know my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap. Î¾CRAP."

"264.content","I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negat review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it possibl that a McDonald could be so bad but unfortun this one is. Î¾ Like mani people, I have eaten at McDonald all over America and even in sever other countries. Î¾I have to say this is probabl one of the worst McDonald I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippin -and that onli becaus I'm not sure that what was in those burger was even beef.Wher do I begin? The servic is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get chees when I ask for none. I get onion when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwich when I ask for 4 appl pies. Î¾I have given up on go through the drive thru becaus I alway end up have to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenag get shake Î¾just to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actual have to tell them, ""No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I order a McDouble.""Th food is almost alway cold. The burger are dri and tast like they have been sit on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 car in the drive thru and 20 peopl in line, I just don't understand how the fri can be cold and stale. It absolut defi logic. Yes, there are time that the food come out hot. It one of the reason I keep go back. There noth like hot Fri from McDonalds.. and also, just becaus it McDonald's. Like it or not, it a stapl for work parent too tire to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortun that they have no competit in the immedi area to keep them on their toes, otherwis they might actual tri to improv their servic and their product. I am sure they are turn a profit. No doubt. It seem to alway be busy. However, I truli believ that if ANi other burger joint open up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Everi time I say I'm never go back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those night as the kid specif request it.

Anyway, the fri were either over cooked,( I don't think so), or cook twice. The amount of salt was unreal and the fri were cook beyond crispy.Second trip, the fri look like McDonald fri just not veri warm, and yes he drove off befor I tri one. We get back to the R.V. resort we'r stay at and I tri my Big Mac, almost no sauc and veri bland. The patti also look like they have gotten smaller.Th two ladi at the window were not over friend but not rude either. If you want a burger just stop at In and Out across the street."

"291.content","I was so excit for this McDonald to open, it about time we get a food place in that location. So you can imagin my disappoint with their terribl servic and bad qualiti food making!! Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few time I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc. I like to go mid-morn on my way to work for either just coffe and a Sausag McMuffin with no egg... How complic of an order can it be??!! Sometim I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usual where they royal screw it up. I'm irrit just think about the visit Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visit they screw someth up. To make this brief, here are my major issues. I order Splenda to be ad to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and care add it myself and spill on my cloth sinc they A) they alway fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make ani more stops! Cheese: hard ever melt on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tri about 3 or 4 times. Chees not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I want the new habanero ranch, couldn't even tast the sauc except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spici with a tini splash of mayo? I mean, really! I order an ice Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hand me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stare at me blank and say yes, I say, I'm use to it have caramel on top, she say it a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm alreadi late becaus they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it a regular mocha. Pathet service!I did write in to corpor after my 8th or 10th attempt to do busi there.. And the manag call me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can rememb me as the Girl who call them out for their shit slow service, alway mess up my orders, Î¾and crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coup sent so I could remain anonymous. Oh well. I just drive a few more block down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond locat if i have the extra time, they are great! As for this place? Shame on you for STILL not be abl to get your shit together! One posit note I will say is there are two veri friend employe there. They work the drive thru take orders/$$ I wish I had their names! Will I be back? Sad probabl yes, it veri conveni for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, tri to keep it simpl and alway hope for the best... Mayb someday they will be a great location... As for now? The McDonald Corpor would be ashamed!!!"

"309.content","I use to go to this one a lot (when fast food was a regular stapl in my diet, in my 20's, when my metabol was faster, and when exercis was not such a priority)- this is one of the older one in town. Recently, we went through the Drive-Thru window for some fruit smoothies. There were a coupl car in front of us. Clear mike, speedi checkout, nice girls, the correct order, and great-tast smoothies. We onli go to McD for a few thing (parfait, cone, and sometim the breakfast sandwich) and even then, it pretti sporadic- mayb a few time a year, becaus of the lifestyl chang we made sinc maintain our weight."

One was for ""McDonald Pizza""Thi thing (the painting) was pretti badass though, that whi I took the pic. It like 10 x 6'. I think it was date 1979. Which make sens consid that Mayor McChees is there and the McKingdom is there tooI swear that place has been forgotten in time. Not onli did it have the vintag artwork but the soda fountain was probabl from the 80 as well becaus the ice machin and soda were complet separ machin and there was a pay phone outsid but it wasn't right outsid the store, it was across the park lot kind of in the bush and had some weird phone compani that I never heard of on it. Plus it had an electron slide door on the main entranc and the ""Play Place"" was outdoor and even had a sing that said ""Pleas Do Not Feed The Birds"". Such a weird place. It cool becaus it remind of the way McDonald was when I was a kid but it scari becaus it not intent retro, it just never changed...It quit the experience.

We went through the drive thru and it was easi and manageable.Thi is a typic McDonald with noth to make them more memor than other locat (in a good or bad way). But if you are stay in the vicin and in need of fast food, do tri them. Their drive thru is also open 24 hour so they are veri conveni if you need calori late at night (which happen a lot in Las Vegas, go figure!). Overall, not a bad McDonald's."

Then when my order was up and I ask for ketchup, she roll her eye and act like I was make her go so far out of her way to reach under the counter. Then, when I went to the fountain to get my drink, there were small bug fli all around it.Best part was when I got back and ate my food and realiz that my fri were cook in the same fryer the do the fish in.

I don't even know where to start! Besid Starbuck and Krispi Kreme this is your onli option for late night eat at The Excalibur. Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...sham on you.Mi husband and I head to the room earli our first night in Vega becaus we were tire after a long drive. After watch some TV my husband said he want a littl someth from our local McDonalds. I was not realli hungri but I was crave a littl someth sweet so I ask him to get me a McFlurri and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He call and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfing I exclaimed! He hang up and call back about a minut later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would'v been use info to have when he first asked! So I end up with Oreo. He come back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurri is soft serv icecream mix with whatev top you get. How do you possibl mess that up? Mess up a McFlurri is equal to the stupid of burn cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chuck were stale. NASTY! My husband burger and fri turn out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....sham on me. After some late night gambl I was hungri and did not feel like search for late night eat so I ventur into this hell hole again. I figur sinc I was get regular food this time it would be ok. The custom servic of this place is atrocious. You are pretti much the onli 24 hour oper that offer more than donut and coffe so chang your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and want a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurri and the guy behind the counter proceed to tell me that the icecream machin is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubbi and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minut of straight Î¾curs he ask for chocol chip cookies, they have none. The onli had oatmeal raisin which I can onli describ is the asshol of cookies. So liter they have no good desserts. So my poor babi goe without what he wants. We are not doughnut fan so Krispi Kreme is not realli appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonald go to the one at The Luxor.

Using my 2-1 coupon, I tri the new Strawberri Frozen Lemonad and yes like the commerci indic it is tart and sweet. These would be a better option to cool you down at $1.59 for a small.

I cring when my kid want to go there. It so foul and not to mention freak expensive. It total unbeliev to me that peopl eat there!"

To temporarili hold over my appetit and enjoy a beverag besid water that I had been drink all the day on the hike, I order the $1 larg Coke and $1 hot & spicy. Î¾Be a new McDonald this locat is modern and for now immacu clean. First off it is a nice first impress when a McDonald is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I enter through modern electr slide doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The worker were on top of their game. There were plenti of booth to choos from. The interior is more contemporari than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What doe exist is a chandeli and a more eleg lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaur that featur the super Coke machin with a 100 plus flavors. The typic Coke flavor they had were not flat. McDonald may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald get the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88."

Î¾When I write a review I tri to look at a uniqu aspect of the business. When it come to fast food restaurants, it take some thinking. What make this McDonald uniqu is that it featur the exact Western motif display throughout Sam Town. It is incorpor in a food court in back of the mountain where the robot Mystic Fall robot anim perform. I don't know of ani McDonald where I could grab a Big Mac and fri and watch a robot cast of anim perform in a laser show, What also make this McDonald; uniqu for a locat off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Ani Size Beverag promotion. Î¾The Sam Town McDonald is one of a few food choic in Sam Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffe and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald is advantag for a light snack or a Larg Coke for the drive home. The time I spend on the line justifi a check-in. It is the McDonald of Sam Town, and it get busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald in the D casino, the employe are friendly.

Tri to give this place a chanc after a coupl of screw up but I just can't do it anymore. And here why.One, look at the storefront photo. I upload that photo here at the time of this review but it was origin taken earli in the year (main becaus I had anoth bad experi and I need to tell everyon not to come here ani more becaus they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fli on the lettuc in my Classic Crispi Chicken Sandwich. I usual order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don't get whi they can't read instruct proper or anything. Whi can't the condiment be separ and not default? It so frustrating. Ani way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they ""got it right"" except for the fli part. I alreadi went in my car so I said ""F it"" so I just took the pictur as proof and then rip the contamin area on the lettuce.I didn't go to this locat for awhil after this incident, but I was crave Chicken McNugget and so sinc it isn't a fresh produc item or whatever, I decid it wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happen twice but I count my nugget and it was miss 1 in the 10 or 20 piec meal. I shouldn't have to count how mani nugget I have, but sad these peopl can't do their job. I don't even get much time to eat lunch so I didn't have time to go back and complain. I'm done with this locat ani way so if I'm crave a sandwich or Chicken McNugget from here, I'll just drive across the bridg and go there becaus it probabl isn't crap like this location. They know they are serv a ton of peopl sinc they are the onli locat but they just do such a bad job. The fri are a bit overpr too and some other thing in case ani of you were think you can get a decent deal on Larg Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton locat near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that it.)Conclusion: If you crave McDonalds, don 't go to this locat unless you want dead fli in Î¾your burgers/sandwich or miss Chicken McNuggets."

I wouldnt bother eat here unless you want to be harass by goofi hoodrat and crack fiend look for someon to give them change. I can think of at least 10 McDonald locat that has staff that don't look like they were pluck from the ghetto garden becaus this McDonald seem to employ hoodrat and ghetto snot to work at this particular location.

Upon enter this establish I came upstair n their vari mani and perus the item hope upon hope that they had Foie gras as I had a tast for the liver of a goose. It was not to be found. They must be anim right activist that run this establishment. I ask the young girl at the counter what their special was and she told me the Big Mac was one of their finer dishes. I place the order along with some French fries, I no longer call them freedom fri now that the French have come fulli on board with our war against Muslim countri #jesuischarli I wonder how these French fri will be served, I am imagin they will be garnish with black truffl . I ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one. How peculiar for a restaur that serv French food. To my horror no baguett either. My food bill come to 6.30 cents. Imagin that, the Big Mac meal , their finest offer and it is onli just over 6 dollars. The wait is not long for my entree, so glad I did not ask for their freedom onion soup. Strang the food is in a box and a carton. This must be a new style , the creativ of chef these day know no bounds. I am impressed. I open up the box and there lie this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dress on it. It is cold and damp. This must be an artist statement of some kind. Possibl a commentari on the ill treatment of the Intuit nativ at the turn of the last century. I am impress by the chef social concern but I had wish that the food was hot. I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet as I made a run for it. They must have been upset that I order the foie gras originally. They are make me pay for it. I know when I have been defeated. My pomm frite were hot but lack ani French accoutrements. This must be French cook under the Vichi govern when the German took away their cream and tri to make them eat sausages. Complet defeat I made my way to the exit sign as I heard a cackl of teenag girl laugh at me as I trip over the yellow wet floor alert signal. This is the last time I will ever eat in a French restaur again. Perhap I should have order the escargot."

In my famili dure that time, eat at Mcdonald was luxuri item. Whi was it a luxury? Becaus my parent high frown upon process and can foods. As a rebelli child grow up, eat at a Mcdonald was luxury. The closest place without a car had to be in McKinley Park. Fast forward a few year and the McDonald express opened. Despit it be fastfood, it pose as a treat to all the local in the neighborhood; after play sport at Mcguan or just grab a quick bite. This Mcdonald is veri small compar to other Mcdonalds, but they do serv most items. Sinc they market their $1 menu coupl of year ago, the dollar menu has never changed. McChicken and Mcdoubl were alway a $1. Now with the advertis $1 breakfast menus and ani size drink, there are a lot of cheap options.

I decid to play it safe with the classic cheeseburg meal with an intimid amount of fri and drink aka ""The Valu Meal"". My meal was serv up a littl too quick with all due credit to the server. The food seem to appear from nowher - gremlin cook the food? I could see the greas seep through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitut request, no coke, coffe instead - a hot beverag will make the greas go down smoother. My server oblig me in silenc and I acknowledg her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front window where park car would treat the diner with blind light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glow light emit from the overhead floresc locat in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and empti the content of the bag, fri and napkins, no ketchup.

No turn back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelm sad for human and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd tast of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhap they co-mingl food in the fryer. The luke-warm tempartur made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Mayb some beer would have help the process.Cheeseburgers. Lift the top bun of ani burger, you can tell right away if there was ani love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burger were not satisfi and tast as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee. I have tast better coffe from a mechan contrapt in a corpor lunch room. It was watery, lukewarm and slight sweet in a way that amplifi everyth that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets.

We thought ""whi not go to McD's"". Seem logical. I mean, McD is alway the same no matter where you go, right? And it was certain conveni located. At least it appear conveni located. Oh, it not. Attempt to cross North Ave. at my intersect is realli a situat where you are take your life into your hands.

And one of the light is onli green for one side of the street, but has no sign indic that anywhere, so peopl either don't stop or just stand there. You feel like you are play Frogger. Except not with a pixel frog, but rather with your own skin and organs.If you make it into the build with your spinal cord still attach to your body, you will see they alway have at least 15 peopl work here. Yet, there are never more than 2 regist open at once. And the onli peopl work those regist are either a. ancient, non-english speak women b. mental handicapped.

Î¾You see, if you'r come from the east, entranc into the lot, either via entranc on North Avenu or Lowel (one way north), is no problem. Î¾If you'r come from the west on North Avenu (or from the south on Kostner), you liter cannot enter the park lot. Î¾At all.

Î¾And you cannot turn left from North Avenu to Lowel becaus there a median (I think: either way, you'r risk an accid or a ticket). Î¾There an alley direct behind the lot, which is not onli fenc off from Mickey D's, but one way go out. Î¾So I drive AROUND THE BLOCK, past Lowel (the one-way street next to McDonald's), to Kildare, back to North Avenue, then enter. Î¾Jesus.

Î¾I felt like rat in a ghetto-maze, onli with a soon-to-be-cold Egg McMuffin.So in a nutshell, if you live west of here, you can't get in. Î¾If you live east of here, you can't get out. Î¾And ya can't realli go north, either. Î¾It maddening. Î¾If you must go to THIS McDonald's, walk or take the bus, seriously. Î¾From my hous (at the halfway point between the two), I will just go down to the one at Kedzie/North. Î¾I realiz McDonald and/or the citi are tri to protect themselv from lawsuit from our shitti driving, and that bad design intersection, but if it that danger (which it is) then just DON'T BUILD IT THERE. Î¾It a squar lot, yet needless complicated. Î¾Grrr."

I had a horribl headach and a long drive back from The Woodland so I just decid to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hope it would help my headache. There were two car in front of me when I pull into the line. One car was at the pick up window, the other was at the intercom to order. It didn't take long for the car in front of me to order. When it was my turn, I liter sat there for 3 minut without anyon acknowledg me. Usualli if the employe are slow, they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customers. I was about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open. Peopl were pull up behind me and I was lose my patience. Final some ladi came on the intercom and said ""What can I get you?"" As if they were the one wait on me to decide. I could hear a lot of nois in the background (sound chaotic). I ask for a grill chicken wrap. She respond with ""We don't have grill meat, wait yeah ok grill what else?"" Then I ask for Sprite. ""We'r out of Sprite."" Ok pleas give me unsweet ice tea. ""OK Sweet tea."" At that point, my headach was so bad I didn't even tri to ask for the frickin unsweet tea. Then she told me to drive forward without tell me a total. As I'm wait to pay and get my food, I see at least two car leav the drive thru line becaus they'r fed up with the poor service. When I got to the window, the ladi even made a comment about it ""Ooooh look at all those car leaving."" I'm sorry, but if you are awar that you are lose customers, mayb you should step it up a littl bit and get your shit togeth so you don't lose customers. She couldn't have care less. It was pathetic.Luckili I don't live in that area, so I'm hope to never have to experi such slow, horribl servic in a drive thru. This was by far, one of the worst experi I've ever had."

"1107.content","This is the worst McDonald i have ever been too. I order a larg soda and 2 dip cones. It was 3 am so there was not much car in line at the drive thru. There was 2 car ahead of me and it took 20 minut to final arriv at the main window. Then it was anoth 10 minut just to give me a soda and 2 dip cones!!! Everyon at the window was act stupid like they had no idea what to do. NO one want to give there face at the window. Everyon includ the manag was just walk around in circl back and fourth. Then final a girl came to the window and ask what was our order readi to hand us food. I forgot to mention that the car in front of us wait so long he just took off and i didn't see him receiv anything. So i told her my order and she left. Then a boy come up and ask us the same thing so i told him. I couldn't believ it, but for the third time the manag goe to the window and ask us what we ordered. I told her Î¾""a larg soda and two dip cones"". WOW i cant believ the manag had to figur out our order after explain it 2 times. She hand me the coke and like 5 minut later a girl come to the window and hand 2 drip cone without napkin so i look at her like really? then she say "" Oh let me give you some napkins""."

There are onli two problems: Lobbi is often messi (but with their cliental be almost entir compris of USC students, I don't fault the restaurant) and longish drive-thru wait times.. but what are you go to do when you have two order lane open?

Î¾No exaggeration! Everytime, yes, everytim I have gone to this drive-thru, they have screw up my order. So you'd better check what in the bag befor you drive off. The trick is to find that perfect time of when to check what in the bag, how to roll up your window to avoid the homeless beggar and how much time to take to examin your bag content without annoy the peopl behind you who have also been wait for 20 minut + in the same drive-thru. Î¾This place is horrible.Th food tast like McDonald food...but over-cook or under-cooked. Î¾It is never just right. Î¾Don't bother with the frozen yogurt either.

This McDonald is just weird.I onli come here becaus my boyfriend like to make a late night run after work. Î¾The drive thru peopl don't speak English and your order is alway wrong. I don't know whi they don't take debit or credit card after a certain time. They alway ask for cash. I find it odd, that all I'm saying. Some of the peopl I don't trust.

My friend alway get salad so sometim they'r out of the kind he usual gets. But again that has happen like 1 or 2 time at most.A for the food, even late at night the food is serv hot so I'm definit satisfi there. Inside is just like ani other Mcdonald with an indoor playpen for kiddies. Overal I haven't had ani bad experi with this place other than the occasion homeless person walk up to your car ask for money when you'r sit in the drive-thru at 2 am. But that has noth to do with McDonalds, you can run into homeless peopl anywhere."
"1120.content","This is the McDonald that my friend and I alway go to sinc it the closest to our apart but at the same time, it definit the WORST one I've ever been to.On plus is that their drive-thru is open 24 hour but sadly, the later at night you go, the more often your choic are limited. For example, one day we were crave their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machin was off alreadi so they couldn't make it! Okay. What the point of stay open 24 hour if you can't even give the custom the food they want?!Th other day, I had a pretti bad dine-in experience. The ladi behind the counter charg extra for big mac sauc on the McDoubl which I have NEVER experienc before. Usualli go through drive-thru, they never charg extra for a McDoubl w/o the ketchup, w/ big mac sauc and shred lettuc (a.k.a a Big Mac, but cheaper!). My boyfriend and I were pretti shock when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauc and she claim that they alway do this which they realli NEVER DO!!Then, this same ladi proceed to close the cash regist befor give me my change! She told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she open it for the next customer. So I patient waited... and then she close the cash regist AGAIN after the next custom and total forgot to give me my change!!!! So I had to remind her again to which she just laugh and semi-apolog and then final gave me my chang after like a decad of waiting! ARGH! Worst McDonald worker ever!! Complet rude and horribl custom servic skills! I total agre with my boyfriend who said this McDonald is veri poor managed. He even wrote a complaint to them a while back but they never responded.

I don't understand the satisfact of scam 99 cent from customers, but whatev make you sleep at night I guess.Th onli reason I ever go to this McDonald is becaus it close to USC and close to my apartment.

They give you the miss item and simpli say ""...there you go, sorry."" No bonuses, no here someth to make up for our crappi service, noth like that!They will not give you ketchup or napkin unless you ask for it so if you forgot, you'll be eat your fri as is!If you order a combo, they would ask you ""...medium or large?"" As if SMALL is not an option, veri tricky!When you order a breakfast meal, they would ask ""Do you want to have orang juic instead of coffee?"" as if there is no differ in price and you have the option of choos juic over coffe without extra cost. They will NEVER tell you that should you make the mistak of choos orang juic you will pay a lot more for the stupid UPGRADE!Is this how McDonald becam the most success franchise?

I alway do that with everi semi-perman place I visit.What I found on my first visit, and subsequ visit was a newfound appreci for McDonald's. I mean, like I felt like a kid again--you know, back when I like it. This McDonald made me like McDonald's, but ONLi this McDonald's! The worker are realli nice and friendly, and this McDonald appar set the record for worker who do not speak English. The bathroom is clean, and I'm glad they make you pay for it--alway a winner in my book! I don't know what it is, but the food actual tast good...lik food! You don't feel like you'r eat crap or trash, it amazing! It good McDonald's, the way it was when you were a five year-old. I can't believ it. I can't explain it. I will dream of eat here again.They have a secur guard, which impress me.

I go to this place for a drink from time to time, my boyfriend is hook on their juice. It is nice, but that about it. They are spend too much on their franchise, market and packaging. Food should look more natur than tri to make it look like on a picture..plastic, silicon and who know what. Ice cream are also OK. But I wouldn't go further than that.Also, I feel sorri for employees."

They also had about 40 peopl behind the counter and 20 of them tri to fix the machine. I lie, but you get the idea. So, I wait and wait and wait and wait for the burger, like 15 minutes. I hate to say stuff, and I could tell they were back up so I kept think it was just get there (other peopl were wait a while, too). I final did say something, and OH WADDYA KNOW. My burger was just sit there at the end of the line.Thes two middl school boy had been wait on someth sinc befor I had got there. I told them just to push up to the front and show them their receipt.

No big deal, I walk back up, explain what happened, and ask if I could have anoth without sauce. I didnt ask to replac mine, as I decid to give that one to a friend, and I just order a new one. A coupl minut later, I got it without sauce, but they also left out the bacon! So I had to go back to the counter, they gave me some bacon to put in but how hard is it to make these things? My second experi that i'd rather forget was when I order a grill chicken chipotl snack wrap. Snack wrap are small as it is, but this one seem to be fold in half of what is the normal size. I went and ask whi it was so small and the guy got a manag who told me the chicken is weigh and it was fine. I have never had a snack wrap like that befor or since.

I got on line behind him. She chit-chat with him and then went and got his food herself instead of let the staff in the back do it. Another 5 minutes. By the time I got to the front of the line, no ""welcome"", not even a smile for me. I order my breakfast. She took my money and then proceed to take the next two orders--thi time, of course, have the staff (which themselv were work at a snail pace) get my food. She hand me the bag with no receipt and no ""thank you"". I thought to complain to the manager, and then I look at the namepl of the person serv me. She WAS the manager.

Then he turn around and left (I assum to continu not do work.)After a wast of 30 minutes, the car behind me left and I was abl to revers my way out. So I have a few recommendations: 1. Sinc your McDonald suck so much pleas do not barricad drive thru attende without an escap route. 2. Learn how to make fast food and 3. Fire your entir incompet staff.

I wish i could give negat star becaus this mc donald was horrible. There was so much trash lie around, my famili and I almost left."
"1513.content","Normal I don't review a chain unless someth about that particular locat stand out, good or bad.Thi locat for some reason, has the most ridicul servic I've ever encountered. Î¾It McDonald you say, what do you expect? Î¾Not much, realli but let me tell you...ENCOUNTER #1I order 10-piec chicken nuggets, fries, and unsweeten ice tea. Î¾I got the nugget and tea. Î¾I went up to the counter, place my receipt on the counter gentl face away from me, and said ""I'm sorry, I --"" Î¾Befor I finish my sentence, the employe SLAMMED her hand on my receipt on the counter and drag it toward her. Î¾Um... WTF?!I didn't know how to react becaus she look at my receipt and threw it away without address me. Î¾I went ""um...ok..."" and back away from the counter to fill my tea. Î¾I have no clue what I did to piss this employe off but my friend who came with me, ask me what the heck happened. Î¾I said ""I have no clue, I'm just miss my fries..."" Î¾Mi friend was nice and *itchi enough to go up to the counter, grab the attent of a differ employe and told him we were miss our fries.But honestly, what is wrong with you? Î¾I'm SORRi you were have a bad day but that doesn't excus you from take it out on a custom who was tri to be nice about an honest mistak that can be easili fixed. Î¾Not a big deal, I paid for fri and I have an incomplet order. Î¾So chill, geez.---------ENCOUNTER #23 friend and I came here for smoothies. Î¾One of my friend order a big mac, nugget and fries. Î¾Everyon els got our orders. Î¾Mi friend wait 20 minut for his order to be done. Î¾No lie, we look at the time on the receipt.You'r thinking, um yea mayb they were cook it. Î¾No...In that 20 minutes, we saw 5 employe goof off, bicker with each other, throw towel at each other, and basically... be extrem unprofessional. Î¾They didn't even do this in the back were custom cant see, they did this all in front of us, just on the other side of the counter. Î¾Base on the manag ask where the order is, they seem to have forgotten about the order.I don't care if you do this at work, but can you do this when no one is wait for their food? Î¾It realli awkward to be stand and wait while watch you goof off AND have your manag ask the team where our order is... THREE times.I realli felt embarrass for the manag becaus this just reflect bad on him but he realli should be more assert and keep his team in check. Î¾For his credit, he did give us a coupon for a free dessert of our choice...which honest is noth becaus I dont ever order a pie, cone, or sundae.oh and our smoothi were not fill all the way to the top... Î¾mine was 75% full."
"1514.content","Everi time I come here they mess up my order....I NEVER leav the drive thru window befor check ani more...."
"1515.content","Don't go here if you'r look for fast food. They'r fast to take your order, but that where it ends."
"1516.content","Ok ok ok, I know it onli a McDonald's, BUT this one is complet differ in decor. It big, clean, bright and pretty. With ton of flat screen all over the place. Another big plus to this McDonald is that they'v got free Wi-Fi (while most hotel charg ridicul fees), so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with busi while munch on some fries.Even though it smack dab on the strip, there plenti of park too!"
"1517.content","Okay so I came in here yesterday around 4:15 P.M. I took a while tri to make up my mind. Î¾I had seen a commerci about the mozzarella sticks. SO I thought I would tri that, a Î¾McDoubl and a medium French fries. When I order I start with the mozzarella sticks. Î¾The cashier thought I said chicken McNuggets. Î¾I correct her and said the mozzarella sticks. Î¾Then I also order the McDoubl and the medium French fries. Î¾Mi order was rung up and I got my order with 5 minutes. That good. Î¾Bad- I can't for the life of me find where the salt, pepper and ketchup is on the first floor. If they have it on the second floor I don't remember. I was in a rush to get home so I grab my food and went to wait for the subway. I look in the bag and was surpris at what I saw. Î¾In my bag was a medium order of French fries, 4 chicken McNuggets, a McDouble, and a pack of marinara sauce. Î¾I use the marinara sauc for the chicken. However, in what languag doe mozzarella stick sound like chicken McNuggets? Î¾And I wonder what the price differ was between the mozzarella stick and 4 piec chicken McNuggets.I alreadi swipe my Metrocard so it wasn't worth it to complain."
"1518.content","The drive thru got our order wrong AGAIN. I call the manag who argu with me about what was ordered. I had to ask her if she care or was even go to help me. She just continu to argu that the drive thru enter what was ordered, yell at me and interrupt me as I told her repeat they took the order wrong and this is not the first time this has happened. After ask if she was go to be of help, she refused, say to call back tomorrow to talk to someon els and hung up on me. Just becaus an employe here doesn't have to be an intellig person doesn't mean they can be rude. I'm sure she is smarter than a dog and even dog know how to be polite."
"1519.content","Breakfast for the famili and kids. Î¾8 of us. Î¾Mess up the whole order. Î¾Miss hot cakes, miss eggs, miss yogurt parfait, four napkins, four ketchups...1 star.BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A MACDONALDs IN VEGAS!"
"1520.content","If I could put zero stars, it would deserv that. Rude rude rude manager. The worst McDonald I have EVER been to. They forc me to buy a LARGE MEAL when I onli want chicken nuggets. How is that legal??! You can't refus to serv what I order becaus you just want to make more money. WORSE. PLACE. EVER. Call to complain. What a scheme."
"1521.content","I enjoy the part where I repeat ask if I had the right sauc 4 times...then didn't. Fuck you McDonalds."
"1522.content","Worst McDonald I've been in in a long time! Dirt everywhere, food bare warmand slow service. Need a manager!"
"1523.content","When I am realli crave for McDonald's, this seem to be the closest. But I'm no big fan of fast food chains.I don't like this locat just becaus there are bum insid wait for the bus to go to Atlantic Citi or whatever...they usual sit and chat and drink some coffee. Same food as ani other McDonald & waitress are friendly!"
"1524.content","Two point right out of the gate: 1. Thuggeri know no race (lili white frat boy from the suburb can be just as vulgar and aggress as ani group with a gang mentality) 2. Rate a McDonald and McDonald food isn't realli an essenti service; peopl general know what they'r get - menu and qualiti wise - go in. The purpos of this review is most about the safeti factor. Peopl need to know (and I think local alreadi do) that, depend on the time of day (night), this place is margin dangerous. Over my last three visit to Chicago, I've notic this neighborhood be overrun by flash mob who do more looting, aggress panhandling, and fight than choreograph performing. In fact, this particular McDonald had to be close down for sever hour a coupl month ago while polic attempt to restor order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increas in gang activ lately, includ the arrest of some arm teenagers. This isn't just my take (check out some of the other review of this place and this neighborhood). Mani are point out that the Mag Mile is slowli becom the ""Mug Mile."" And this McDonald seem to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after take up two seat on the subway while grandma has to stand. Apologist and the agenda driven will say (and have said): ""These kid are guilti of noth other than be black in a predomin white neighborhood."" Really? Sinc when doe be authent ""black"" includ scream nonstop obscen with littl kid around (black and white)? Sinc when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Sinc when did it becom open season on civility? [Sinc when did my review start read like the rant of some terrifi reactionary/fascist?] While it mild funni that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolli buy mommi must sometim contend with this thuggeri after they leav the American Girl Doll store, nobodi (not even the over-privileged, countri club set) should have to endur this genuin menac behavior. And youth thug (of ani race) should NOT be permit to turn this area into the ""Wild mid-West."" Just a thought, Rahm - do what you want with it."
"1525.content","I want to grab breakfast one morn befor work sinc it just across the street, but the restaur was fill with homeless people! It like their hangout spot... I wait a lot longer than I need to just to order. If they didn't have bum loiter around, mayb would have ad one more star. The staff is not the problem, they look like they actual have to deal with a lot if problemat people. They should focus on make the place a littl pleasant for their guest. No one want to eat their burger while have to endur the smell if urin linger off a homeless person."
